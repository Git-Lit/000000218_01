  ALONE IN LIFE.


Almost in the middle of that wind-swept
plain which lies between Blois and Chartres,
and dooms to unsightly monotony the central
Provinces of France, stands a small village
called St. Martin. "Within memory of not even
the oldest inhabitant, it had been a hamlet,
and its present village-state was an evidently
transitory one. It was creeping slowly but
steadily on to become a town. That would
depend upon the precise spots chosen as stations
for the railway line, when a certain branch,
anxiously waited for, should be completed.
For the moment, St. Martin was a village,
and, as is usual in even the richest French  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  B
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: 2 -->
districts, it was neither a picturesque nor a
clean one.


As far as it went, the little place was
possessed of all its requisites. It had a mayor
with his belongings, a cure, a schoolmaster, a
Garde Champetre, and a post-mistress. It
could want nothing more, and was certain of
being well and sufficiently administered.


The five or six hundred individuals
composing the population of St. Martin inhabited
a collection of stray tenements, irregularly
dotted about the straight line of road which
led from Blois to Tours, and which, looked
at from a balloon, would have seemed a mere
patch on the broad, flat garment of the plain.
On the right-hand side, as you came from Blois,
stood the church, a small edifice, terribly out
of repair, with its traditional porch, beneath
which the peasants congregate on rainy
Sundays, and its traditionally crooked spire, bent,
as the said peasants believe, by the
inexorable north-west winds. On either side of,
and opposite to, the church, extended what
<!-- Leaf 15, Page: 3 -->
was called the Street, and, when what the
street regarded as its shops came to an end,
it led forth towards the open fields, over a
bridge, beside which lay the pond, where
washerwomen were for ever at work, and
merged at length, about a mile further on,
into the high-road from Tours to Chartres.


Flat, flat, dreary, bare, uninteresting. That
is the traveller's impression as he crosses these
monotonous plains, whereon a bush is a
prominent feature, and a group of trees what
French people call an event. Uninteresting ?
Yes, to you who pass on and go your way;
but to those whose way it is to abide here,
full of interest, life-stirring and terrible as any
that ever formed the ground-work of historic
dramas.


Nearly opposite the little dilapidated church,
with its dumb clock, whose rusty hands
eternally pointed to half-past three, and whose
rusty, arrow-shaped weathercock never swerved
from N.N.W., stood a shop with ban-ed door
and closed shutters. Upon a broad stripe of  
  
  
  B 2
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 4 -->
dirty white, which extended all round the
habitation, was inscribed in big, black letters, the
following legend:—  
  
  
  Widow Raynal, Grocer and Vintner.


The shop formed the corner of the street,
inasmuch as, whilst one side of it opened upon
the street, the other had its windows upon a
small, open space, terminating in a narrow,
muddy lane, and the door of the shop itself
formed the apex of the uncouth triangle, blunted
and flattened by two uneven door-steps of grey
stone. Just across the open space we have
mentioned (some twenty or thirty yards square)
rose a building three stories high, with a smart
balcony to its first-floor—a hotel, forsooth ! not
an inn, or an ale-house, or anything so rustic
or unimportant—but a hotel with a bran new
sign, on which was blazoned forth, in gold
upon bright blue, nothing less than the words,
A l'Hotel de l'Europe.


Europe! Nothing less, it seemed, would suit
the magniloquence of this village hostelry, very
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 5 -->
empty and forlorn to all appearance in the
present, but prescient,— who knows?—with
yet dormant greatness in a dim
railway-to-bedeveloped future. At all events, the Hotel
de l'Europe looked down crushingly upon its
opposite neighbour, the closed shop, very much
as a newly made peeress might upon a humble
school-fellow, destined to be dropped. Between
the two, upon the square space intervening,
were to be seen a couple of odd vehicles
resting on their shafts; one the half-drag,
halffourgon like equipage of a commercial traveller,
the sole lodger in Europe's hotel; the other,
the lumbering, tumble-down conveyance,
destined for the transport of travellers to and from
Blois, the master of the European resting-place
exercising the right of furnishing the relays to
the coach, which still, in default of a local
railroad, served as about the only means of
conveyance between two or three provincial
towns.


Yes; the flaunting house of cheer might
well look down upon the gloomy house over
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 6 -->
the way, with its sealed entrances; for behind
those closed-up channels of light and life there
had passed a miserable series of woful scenes,
which would only have been a shade more
woful still, had the poor, hard-striving, utterly
helpless, and, at last, despairing Widow Raynal,
Grocer and Vintner, lived to witness them.


The Widow Raynal had not always been
alone and a widow. Her history was that of
many of the women of her class, and none the
less sorrowful for that.


Some thirty years ago, Claude Raynal, the
son of the land-steward of a wealthy proprietor
near Chartres, started in life with what was
called a good education, very little money, but
the protection of his father's employer; and
this very protection ruined him. Though his
school-gains amounted to what might be
deemed little enough, Claude proved, for his
particular character, to have too much
education and too little money. He was always
thinking of enjoyment without labour, and grew
to be so convinced that mere protection could
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 7 -->
and ought to secure for him all he desired, that
when protection either could or would not do
what he expected, he regarded himself as an
injured man. In the beginning protection
acted in his favour, and helped him to his first
lift in life, by placing him as unpaid clerk in
the Receveur-particuliers office; but Claude
disliked work and no pay, and refusing the
work which was to lead to pay, the pay never
came, and protection refused to help him who
did not choose to help himself. Well, Claude
Raynal tried many things, always with the
same object in view-—of obtaining more than
he paid for—the most marked feature in the
dishonesty of our age—and one day, when
he was somewhere about five-and-twenty, his
father announced to him that he had found a
wife for him. The girl was the only child of
a well-to-do peasant near Blois, was well
brought up, not pretty, and would at her
father's death inherit sundry strips and morsels
of land—du bien ! as the people of that class in
France call it.
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 8 -->

They married and went to live with the
peasant father near Blois. They had two or
three children, and, in course of time, the two
fathers both died, and Claude Raynal and his
wife came into the enjoyment of whatever they
were to be possessed of. The bits of land
ruined them utterly, as land in such conditions
ruins many thousands of petty proprietors in
France. Claude fancied he had some aptitude
for agriculture, and not having land enough to
test these aptitudes upon, he borrowed money
to buy a bit or two more, and a very short
time saw him beggared of almost everything
he possessed. When the irretrievable ruin had
set in, then, as invariably happens in such
cases, began the martyrdom of the wife. This
endured fifteeen years, the one great marvel
being how the poor wretched woman contrived
to keep all their heads above water for such a
long lapse of time. But she did so. Some
little resources were left to her, and when she
had once seen clearly into her husband's nature,
she thought herself justified in concealing them
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 9 -->
from him. To these she added the produce of
her own hard labour, and now and then
persuaded Claude, into accepting odd jobbs, which
by dint of entreaty, and the esteem people had
for her industry, she obtained for him. But
this was rare. Claude Raynal looked upon his
wife as especially appointed by Providence to
take care of him. She occupied the place
Protection refused to fill- in his early days, and
upon her he persistently, ruthlessly, leant until
the day when it pleased the Almighty to
remove him from this earth. Luckily, about two
years before the period at which our story
opens, Claude Raynal died, and—his wife
regretted him!


Yes! Claude had been weak, lazy,
ungrateful, useless—he had deliberately drained to the
very dregs every resource which his helpmate
had to dispose of, and had never thanked her;
he had made her entire existence one long
succession of various and unceasing toil, whilst
he indulged in all the debauchery he could
practise without falling under the clutch of the
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 10 -->
law; he had come across the path of this
poor, striving, honest woman, and doomed her
to incurable miser}', and the only child that
was left them —a girl —to total destitution.
All this, and even more, had Claude Raynal
done, but he had been the means of raising
this woman's self-esteem to the highest point
it could attain in so humble a sphere as hers,
and she was tender of him for the superiority
he gave her. People in this position know
nothing of moral or mental processes, but dimly
feel results. Claude's unenlightened, struggling
wife had no consciousness of what was passing
within her, but she strove and suffered for her
wretched husband with a brave maternal
tenderness; and when he lay dead before her—
dead, at last, from drunkenness—she felt that
the chief cause of her great worth, of her
womanly worth, had departed, and she grieved.


Besides all this, too, the man's illness had
cost money, for it had lasted long after repeated
attacks of delirium tremens had enfeebled him;
and his burial, which the widow resolved should
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 11 -->
be a decent one, cost something more, and her
own strength, momentarily shattered, was
insufficient for the increased work demanded of
it, and so the widow Raynal had to sell the last
of her small belongings, a cottage with its
kitchen-garden, a source till now of gain.


When all was settled a small sum remained;
it was very small, but it would vanish if not
utilized. And accordingly the Widow Raynal
decided upon purchasing the goodwill of the
grocer's business belonging to the corner shop
we have described in the village of St. Martin.
To do this, she had to borrow five hundred
francs, her own meagre resources not sufficing,
so she began her new business with her future
profits already, to a certain degree, pledged.
However, the old activity re-awoke, and, at
the end of a year, the widow was straining
through her hardships and had paid half her
debt.


She had added to her grocery, and
odds-andends trade (all things generally from woollen
stuffs, writing-paper, and fireworks down to
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 12 -->
marbles) a manner of wine-shop, and in a side
room there were two or three tables at which
the wine of the country could be drunk, pipes
smoked, and the Siecle read.


But one day, the progress of our age asserted
itself, and the house with a balcony, and three
stories, and a bright blue sign, rose up over
the way, and the Hotel de l'Europe
overwhelmed the miserable drinking-shop opposite.
The Hotel de l'Europe opened a cafe where
absinthe was to be had, and wherein a counter
of shining zinc mirrored itself in a glass with a
gold frame, and the days of the wine-shop were
numbered.


The widow struggled still, for it was in her
nature to do her utmost; but she struggled
feebly, for, in the first place, the flesh was not
equal to the will, and, in the next, she knew
herself vanquished. The spirit of the time had
beaten her, and she despaired without knowing
why. She stared stupidly at the big house
rising up before her, was ignorant of its
connection with railways and progress, but bowed
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 13 -->
down before the grandeur of the zinc counter.
That, she knew, she could not resist.


A month before our tale opens, the widow
Raynal had died.


By the side of the woman, whose life had
been one long sacrifice, stood a girl of
seventeen, utterly unknowing what the immediate
future of life would be to her.


Madeleine Raynal was familiar with
hardship. From the time she could receive
impression, the difficulty of living had impressed itself
upon her. All the children born before her had
died; she alone remained; healthy as far as
mere health went, not active, and not possessed
of any attraction — a tall, pale girl, with a
muddy skin, on which the fair hair made no
contrast, and what the other mothers of the
place called an unpleasant look about the
eyes. Her own mother loved her dearly.


Not at first, however, for, when she was
born, trouble already sat at the hearth of the
Raynals, and the wife's energies were absorbed
in taking charge of her husband. He was
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 14 -->
really her child; and to her he deferred and
submitted. With all his faults, he never, even
when stupid with drink, had spoken to his wife
an angry word; and, for this, she requited
him; mourning inwardly for his
loss—mourning' too all the more that she did not dare let
her grief appear. She would have been sneered
at and blamed—this, she knew.


But when the grown-up infant was gone, the
mother turned to the girl; and though there
was no sentimentality between them—(there
never is among such poor hard workers as
these)—they clung to each other closely as
human creatures do upon a raft after a
shipwreck.


Life was a shipwreck to them, and a day lived
through was a gain.


Madeleine was brought up as best she could
be; sent to the salle d'asile from the age of
two to that of seven, and to the communal
school till she was fourteen. She could read,
write, sew, and cast up accounts tolerably, but
she was decreed to be a dull child, and so,
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 15 -->
indeed, she looked; and she was never
anybody's pet or favourite. The sisters never
petted her, nor M. le Cure" either, nor any of
the ladies in the chateaux roundabout; and
Madeleine grew up an unnoticed, uninteresting
girl.


The widow Raynal was beginning to think of
what she could do with her daughter, when she
died—died suddenly; inasmuch as long years
of toil and a few months of despair had
annihilated all power of resistance, when disease came
in the form of bilious fever, she was at once
struck down.


At her mother's death Madeleine learnt what
it is to be destitute. She had only known
privation hitherto, and though cold and hunger
had approached her more than once, she did
not know what it was to shiver and be without
one loo: of wood or even warm ashes for the
foot-pan, or to crave and be without one crust
to still the craving. This it was which 
learnt when the Widow Raynal died.  
  
  
  As the half-yearly rent for the shop had been
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 16 -->
over-due more than a month, the proprietor
took his precedence of other creditors, and
seized. As the poor wooden coffin, borne on
one man's shoulder, was carried out of the shop,
the bailiff walked into it, and took possession of
all it contained, except one bed.


When Madeleine came home from seeing
her mother's remains put into the common
grave of paupers, she found the men of law
at their grim work; which was soon ended,
there was so little to seize. The proprietor was
not a bad man, and he said the girl might stay
a few days. She tried to do so; and,for two
days, continued to eat the small remains of food
she could find. She thought that grief for her
mother's loss possessed her; so it did till the
animal wants came. But the cold (it was a
sharp November) pinched her; and hunger
gnawed at her, and the darkness and solitude
frightened her, and, on the fourth day, she ran
out, leaving the door open behind her, and,
darting over the threshold of a neighbouring
dwelling (the little sabot-maker's shop by the
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 17 -->
church across the road), she caught at the figure
of a woman who was bending over a pot upon
the fire, and, joining her hands, exclaimed, " Oh,
Madame Perrot! " and burst into a fit of
convulsive sobbing.  
  
  
  The sabot-maker's mother, a widow also,

and also very poor, took the unfortunate girl
to her heart, warmed her, fed her, soothed her;
and, with a charity which rarely fails women of
the poorer classes in France, prevented
Madeleine Raynal from being crushed out of reason
or life by the overwhelming sense of utter
loneliness.

  CHAPTER II.  
  
  
  THE APPEAL.


A month went by, and the keen winds of
the plains made the frosts of December more
biting. Madeleine Raynal had been warmed
and fed, and there was a low straw chair
by the side of the fire in the sabot-maker's
abode, where the girl might be seen, day after
day, cowering over the carefully covered embers.
She did nothing; but, her terror and her
physical wants allayed, she seemed to accept
naturally the fact of support given to her by another
almost as poor as herself. All the dullness of
her nature had returned to her, and the truest
mode of describing her parasite existence would
be to say that she hung about. Those who
remembered Claude Raynal, shrugged their
shoulders contemptuously, and opined that the
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 19 -->
father's lazy, dependent character was fast
coming out in the girl. Poor Madame Perrot
said nothing, uttered no reproach, went on
dividing her humble cheer with her guest, and
sought vainly to find some employment by
which Madeleine might earn her livelihood.
She found nothing.


But there was in the sabot-maker's dwelling
some one who looked grudgingly on the portion
of existence which was subtracted from the
little household by Madeleine, and this was the
sabot-maker himself. Denis Perrot was ten
years older than Madeleine; and had once or
twice, as a boy, taken notice of her: nay, almost
taken her part against others, and the
consequence had been a kindlier feelhig between
these two than had perhaps existed between
anyone else and the uninteresting child of the
unlucky Raynals. But Denis had met writh an
accident to his hip, in the early autumn; an
abscess had ensued, he had had to take to his
bed, and, for the last three weeks, had been
incapable of any work at all. Nothing in thedoo 2
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 20 -->
main of sentiment, no childish memories, had
they been ever so strong, could endure against
the animal selfishness of the sick workman. As
he lay in his bed, in the small room on the
ground-floor, which was kitchen, shop,
bedroom, everything, you might see him casting
glances of fierce envy at Madeleine, as she took
from his mother a bowlful of the soup, into
which it cost so dear to put even pork, let alone
a bone of beef with any flesh upon it. The
doctor had said that the invalid's strength must
be kept up, and here was this stranger sapping
this strength by her unconscientious appetite.
She was devouring what was to be the marrow
of his bones. He hated her : one day he told
her so. They were alone; and the hard words
and bitter reproaches that issued suddenly from
the lair, on which she thought Denis was
sleeping, stung Madeleine to the quick, and roused
whatever was dormant in her sluggish nature.
Perhaps some spark of her mother's energy lay
under the ashes after all.  
  
  
  " You have no right to stay here," said, at
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 21 -->
last, the sick man, in a querulous tone. " You
are eating my mother's substance; you should
go away."  
  
  
  " Go where ? " retorted Madeleine.


\"I'm sure I can't tell," was the reply; " but
somewhere—anywhere. You ought to do
something."  
  
  
  " Do what ? " asked the girl.


\"Well, I'll tell you what," and Denis raised
himself on his elbow with a sudden
inspiration; " go up to the chateau yonder. This very
morning, the gardener, Jean Louis, was down
here about his sabots, and told how the ladies
have as good as lost their maid, who has got
the typhus fever. They're going up to Paris
next week; go and get 'em to take you as
their maid. Go! that would be a rare fine
thing."


The girl had risen to her feet, and was
{empty}.standing looking intently into the fire.


\"A chambermaid ? " she repeated, gloomily.
■"A servant?—a drudge ! "  
  
  
  " Yes," growled the sabot-maker; " you'd
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 22 -->
rather beg than work : rather eat my food than
work for your own ! "


There was a suppressed savageness in his
tone that overawed Madeleine.


\"I will go and try, Denis," said she,
submissively; and she put on her shawl
and her sabots, and went her way to the
chateau.


The Chateau de Clavreuil was about a mile
off, in a straight line. You went down the
road from Blois to Tours, crossing the road
from Tours to Chartres, and, on the other side,
at the end of a long, straight, lime avenue,
stood a massive building, in the style of Louis
XIII., the habitation of the Comte Rene de
Clavreuil, one of the four or five large
landowners of the province, who lived there with
his wife and only daughter during seven or eight
months of the year.


It was past three when Madeleine set out on
her errand; it would take her nearly an hour
to get to Clavreuil, so she had to make haste,
for the day was a lowering one, with dark
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 23 -->
clouds upon the horizon, and night falls early
in December.


She walked quick, and reached the house
before the clocks struck four. With some little
trouble she obtained admittance to the Countess's
presence, and began to recount the sad story of
her life, and her mother's trials, before asking
for anything definite; for it became apparent,
even to her dull perceptions, that there was a
terrible gulf between her own wretchedly clad
person and the meanest domestic of this
wellappointed household. She felt she must first
interest her hearers; she tried to do so—and
failed.


Madame de Clavreuil's reputation for charity
stood firm and lofty in the neighbourhood of
St. Martin. There was no school, no asylum,
no refuge, no foundation of any kind, within
twenty miles, that did not count her among its
patronesses. She was active and large-handed,
and still fair to look upon, and all good
Christians blessed her.  
  
  
  In the room into which Madeleine Raynal
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 24 -->
was shown everything breathed comfort and
peaceful happiness. There was warmth and
the perfume of sweet flowers, and pure women;
and no goodlier sight could be well imagined
than Madame de Clavreuil bending over her
embroidery frame, on which glowed a
magnificent priestly stole, and her young daughter
Claire, who was reading aloud to her the life
of St. Elizabeth of Hungary.


When Madeleine entered, the Countess looked
up from her embroidery, her daughter laid down
her book upon the table. Both ladies looked at
the unattractive, meanly-dressed girl, and she
felt that all courage, and nearly all coherence
of thought had departed from her. She told
her story lamely.


\"Why did M. le Cure never speak to me of
your mother, my poor child?" inquired Madame
de Clavreuil, with a gentleness of tone and look
that ought to have encouraged the petitioner,
but did not do so.


'We scarcely knew him," was the reply;
"he never came to us."
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 25 -->

;' You should have gone to him," rejoined the
lady.


\"Mother had no time. It was all work at
home. There were days when she was up at
two o'clock in the morning, and there were
nights when she never got to bed at all."


\"And Sundays when you never went to
church," interposed Madame de Clavreuil, not
severely, but as though it pained her to
say it.  
  
  
  The girl hung her head,


\"Madame la Comtesse," murmured she, " let
alone the work, mother had not always clothes
in which she could go to mass. She had been
better off, and was ashamed."  
  
  
  Madame de Clavreuil shook her head.


\"Ashamed! " she echoed, with a sigh—
"ashamed to go to the house of God! I am
afraid, Madeleine, that what has been said to
me more than once was too true; that your
poor mother relied too much upon herself, and
not enough upon the only support that avails. It
is a grievous fault; but we will hope it is forgiven
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 26 -->
her. She died, having received all the
sacraments, did she not ? "


\"All," answered Madeleine; adding naively,
\"M. le Cure" said all was quite in order; but
I never saw him again since the funeral."


\"You have lived since then at Mother
Perrot's," observed the Countess; " M. le Cure
could not go there. Denis Perrot is a noted
scoffer, and his mother performs few or none
of her religious duties."


\"I was dying of want, and had not a crust
to eat when Mother Perrot took me in,"
objected Madeleine; " if she had not given me
food, I must have starved in the street."


A casual spectator who should have
witnessed this interview between Madame de
Clavreuil and Madeleine Raynal would have
been inclined to suppose that the dauntless
energy and self-reliance of the poor dead widow
had left to her child an inheritance of distrust.
She was evidently distrusted because her
mother had committed the impiety of
overtrust in herself. All this time Claire de
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 27 -->
Clavreuil never took her eyes from Madeleine's
face, but gazed at her with an intent and
curious gaze.  
  
  
  After a short pause in the conversation :—


"What can I do to help you?" said the
Countess, compassionately; " what was it you
came to ask of me ?"


Madeleine stared in amazement, for the
original object of her visit had been driven
momentarily out of her head, and the
consciousness of her fearful needs brought it back
to her with a shock. She blushed, and then
turned pale, and, clasping her hands together,


\"Oh, Madame la Comtesse," stammered she,
\"take me into your service."


Madame de Clavreuil put away her
embroidery frame, and turned her chair half round, so
as fully to front the supplicant.


\"Take you into my service ? " she said,
kindly; " but, my poor girl, what can you
do?"


At this question Madeleine revived as at the
contact of a vague hope.
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 28 -->

\"What can I do ?" she repeated, almost
briskly; " I can read and write well, and do
anything in the way of work. Oh ! madame,"
she continued, emboldened, and coming nearer
to the Countess, "take me as your maid in
place of Mademoiselle Celeste, who is so ill."


The difficulty was surmounted, the worst
was done; she had made the request, and now
she would struggle hard to obtain it. Madame
de Clavreuil's first impression had been
evidently one of blank surprise, and she instantly
repressed it. It was succeeded by a look of
pain and pity.


\"The place of lady's maid in Paris (and we
shall be there next week) requires experience,
which you have not," observed she, gently;
"it would be impossible for you to fulfil its
duties."


At the word impossible, the whole sense of
her destitute position rushed back upon
Madeleine, and lent her an energy which was not in
her every-day nature.  
  
  
  " Oh ! madame," she cried, desperately, " try
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 29 -->
me. I can do more than you think, and I must
starve if you do not take me."


Madame de Clavreuil made an imperceptible
sign to her daughter, who left the room.


\"Madeleine," said she, rising, and coming
close to the petitioner, " your inexperience and
incapacity are not the real reasons for my being
unable to give you a situation in my house.
The real reason is—" she hesitated—" the
real reason is, that it would be giving a bad
example."


The girl fixed her eyes upon her in speechless
bewilderment.


"My poor child," continued Madame de
Clavreuil, with real compassion, and taking the
girl's hand in hers, " you and your unfortunate
mother have never set a good example. I do
not accuse you of unbelief—God forbid!—but
you never showed any piety; you have not
been well-noted in your classes, my poor
Madeleine. I do not speak of laziness,
doggedness, hardness of disposition; those are
human defects—but you have shown no love
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 30 -->
for our divine religion. You have set a bad
example, Madeleine; it was remarked that
you passed through your first communion with
indifference, and for two years you have not
been to confession. My poor girl, if I took
you into my house I should be flying in the
face of my duty, and doing an injustice. I
have a daughter; my maid attends upon her.
I could not allow "


\"Madame la Comtesse," burst forth the girl,
with sudden fire, " no one living can say any
harm of me."


\"In a certain sense, none, Madeleine," was
the reply; " but I should be rewarding a
manifest neglect of religious duties if I engaged
you in my service. I have, moreover, already
promised Celeste's place to Justine Vaud."  
  
  
  "To Justine Vaud!" ejaculated Madeleine

—"to the daughter of the carpenter, who has
been saving money all his life ? "


"And who is a model of piety," rejoined
Madame de Clavreuil. " But, my dear child,
I will come to your aid also, though in another
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 31 -->
way. Go home, be patient, offer up your
sufferings to our Lord, go to the Sisters, go to
{empty}M. le Cure; I will see them all to-morrow on
your behalf, and be convinced that it is never
too late to mend. Return to God with true
fervour, and you may yet set a good example
to those around you."


Madeleine wept and knelt and implored, but
all in vain, and when she left Madame de
Clavreuil's presence, she did so without hating
her, for she knew Madame de Clavreuil was
sincere.


If no harm were done in the world save by
the evil-minded seeking to do evil, we poor
mortals should have less to complain of than
we fancy; but our chiefest miseries spring from
the mistakes of the common-minded seeking to
do good. Madame de Clavreuil had the kindest
heart in the world, which she was for ever
striving to put down; she had a second-rate
intellect, and had blindly accepted whatever
had been taught her, clinging to whatever she
deemed her duty with determination. It broke
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 32 -->
her heart to wound anyone, but she had had
narrow precepts early instilled into her, and
she followed them narrowly. When Madeleine
had left her she simply sat down and wept for
pity, and said to herself: " Oh ! how hard it is
to do right! " and the reason why Madeleine
did not curse her in her heart was, that upon
even her dull sense, it was borne in that the
Countess suffered whilst doing what she
believed her duty.


In a passage leading towards the door, which
opened on the steps descending into the
stableyard, a tall, slight figure brushed by, a light
touch was laid on Madeleine's arm, and a
silvery voice said :—


\"My poor, poor, girl—take this," and a
small silver medal was put into her hand.


She looked up, and met the sweet,
sympathising, pure glance of Claire de Clavreuil.


"I have nothing else," said Claire, "but
promise me to wear this always, and to pray
fervently to the Blessed Virgin. She will help
you."
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 33 -->

The look was a dull, stupid one, with which
Madeleine Raynal stared first at the medal and
then at its giver, and before she could thank
the latter she was gone.


When Madeleine reached the stable-yard it
was raining. She put her old grey shawl over
her head, and went towards the gate opening
on the road.


As she passed before an open door, she
perceived two young men standing at it. They
were in riding costume, rather bespattered with
mud, and were apparently but just arrived.
Why she stood still, when she came close to
them, she did not herself know.


\"Who are you ? " said one of the two;
\"where do you come from ? Do you want
anyone here ? "


She came closer, and drew her shawl tighter
over her head, "I am the Widow Raynal's
daughter from St. Martin," she replied, " and
I am starving."


\"Starving! " echoed he who had already
spoken, but not in a particularly kind tone;  
  
  
  VOL. I. D
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 34 -->
however, he put his hand into his pocket, and
holding out a five-franc piece, " take that,
then," he added, "though I confess I never
exactly know what people mean when they talk
of starving—nobody ever actually starves."


\"Yes they do ! " retorted Madeleine, and, as
she came nearer, the light of the lamp over the
stable-door fell upon her face.


She left the yard slowly, lingeringly, and
before she had done so, she overheard the
following dialogue between the two young men.  
  
  
  " Good God! what a strange face," said one.  
  
  
  " Strangely ugly," said the other.  
  
  
  " Strangely, curiously beautiful!" replied the

first.


\"That's what comes of being a painter,"
observed his friend. " You painters see what you
call beauty in what is positively hideous."


"I see beauty when it is only latent," was
the rejoinder. " Look at the form of that girl's
mouth and nose and brow; look at the line of
the eyebrows; it reminds one of the Medusa;
how I should like to study that head ! You,
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 35 -->
Olivier, only see the muddy, insignificant
colouring; but feed the girl well, and you
would soon see how she'd come out. She's
only hungry."


\"Br-r-r!" responded he who had been called
Olivier. " I have no taste whatever for a
hungry heroine. I tell you it is only you
artists who see beauty in your dreams, and
distribute it to those who have no trace of it
in themselves. Besides, how can a woman be
otherwise than ugly unless she is dressed: a
sloppy, ragged, draggle-tailed girl with a dirty
shawl over her head is not a woman. Bah!
my dear Henri, it maybe hard and unchristian,
and all that sort of thing, but the poor are
always ugly."

  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  OUT ON THE ROAD.


It was almost dark when Madeleine got back
to the high road. She crossed it, and struck
into the causeway leading straight to St. Martin
before she distinctly perceived how hard it had
been raining.


Like all such roads in France this said
causeway between Tours and Blois was perfectly
well kept; but still a heavy shower did disturb
its exquisite propriety, and leave long lines of
water in its ruts, however shallow these might
be.


The night was coming on, wet and gusty,
such as the nights so often are in early -winter,
in the milder provinces of France. A truly
miserable night.  
  
  
  As yet it was but just beginning to unfold
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 37 -->
its mantle, for it was not much over five
o'clock, but the foreshadowings of night were
gloomy. Large masses of black clouds drifted
across the sky like rent draperies of a funeral
pall, whilst towards the horizon there lingered
on pale streaks of dying day, that were indeed
ghastly. The wind moaned and whistled, not
having yet risen into fury, and swept sadly
over the earth with that peculiar tone it takes
when sweeping over bare plains, where there
are no trees. The rain did not fall down
straight from above, but seemed, as if it were
blown about by handfuls, and thrown at the
passer-by, man or beast, fitfully. Ever and
anon, out struggled a beam of the scarcely
risen moon, like a mute appeal against the
terrible clouds that were bent upon flinging
their sables over its light.


A dismal evening truly, and a dismal form
was that which toiled on upon the road; the
form of that sloppy, draggle-tailed girl, with a
dirty shawl over her head!  
  
  
  Yes! Madeleine was all that. Before she
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 38 -->
had striven half her way back she was wet
through, and the wretched garments she had
on clung to her limbs. Her shawl was dirty,
old, torn in some places, patched in others,
and as its unsightly folds fastened clammily
upon her cheek and brow, they fixed the long
tresses of hair, deranged by the wind, in her
mouth, or in her eyes, and she was forced with
one hand to dash them away, while with the
other she must keep a tight hold upon her
clothes, so as not to have them torn away by
the gusts which were gradually increasing in
strength. Her shoes were worn, and had
holes in them, and the water got into them,
and at each step, she heard her feet go plash,
plash.


This outcast girl did not do what perhaps
you or I might do, but what in her position
no one ever does; she did not indulge in any
abstract or philosophical reflections, or go
from the known to the unknown,
cursingsociety and the high-born or wealthy as the
causes of her suffering. She simply felt the
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 39 -->
physical ills that assailed her, felt deadly cold,
and miserably wet and worn out from
struggling against the wind, but she did not connect
society or any established order of things with
her misery. Like men in battle, who only
realise what goes on immediately around
themselves, Madeleine Raynal, in this her battle of
life, saw no further than the individual beings
near to her, who had wounded or were
threatening her.


She did not hate Madame de Clavreuil
perhaps, because, as I have said, she felt her
truth; or, perhaps, because she had lost all
memory of her refusal of aid in the sense of a
deeper wound more recently dealt.


She hated the man she had heard called
Olivier, and she shuddered with terror when
she thought of Denis Perrot.


Madame de Clavreuil had told her to go
home. But where was her home? She had
none. She had the five-franc piece in her
hand that had been given her in the
stableyard at the Chateau; but after that had fed
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 40 -->
her for three or four days, say a week, where
should she go then ? She did not dare think
of going back to Mother Perrot's, or of again
touching with her longing lips the food which
was destined to restore strength and the power
of earning his bread to Denis. She was
afraid of the man; afraid he would murder
her; and, in the midst of all her trouble, of
her hunger, and cold, and utter desolation, she
did not think of suicide, nor even of death. On
the contrary, strange as it may seem, she thought
of life, dimly, involuntarily, if you will, but her
instincts, all, set lifewards, not deathwards.


She had heard all that had been said of her
in the stable-yard, and the woman in her had
been awakened as well as humbled to the dust.
She was like a savage to whom, on a desert
island, a genius should give the Koh-i-noor,
with the knowledge of its worth. Her
possession of a treasure had been revealed to her;
but what to do with it ? She hated the man
who had said she was ugly; but the man who
had said she might be beautiful had troubled
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 41 -->
her far more. He who pronounced her ugly
did not provoke her rancour, because he called
her so, for she did not believe him (she believed
the other, who said she could achieve beauty)
—she hated him because he denied to her the
means whereby the beauty could be achieved.
He doomed her to ugliness from her needs, and
therein he spoke Truth, and the truth only has
power to impress profoundly. He had said
that a sloppy, draggle-tailed girl, with a dirty
shawl round her head, was not a woman, and
she felt that to be true, and that she was that
girl. The other had said she was only hungry;
it was true, she was hungry. He had said her
beauty would be apparent if she were properly
fed! who was there to feed her ?


I say again, we none of us rebel against
Truth. We deny it to be the truth. But
Madeleine could not deny. The belief she accorded
to the man who had affirmed her capacity of
beauty was a matter of Faith and Instinct, for
she had hardly ever seen her own face in a
glass, and her mind had never been turned
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 42 -->
towards the notion of her own outward
semblance. Her life had been too hard and too
unsociable for that. But the truth she
recognised as palpable was, the cold, the hunger, the
misery, the poverty, that denied to her the
possibility of ever being otherwise than unsightly.  
  
  
  "The poor are always ugly."


Madeleine thought that sounded like a
deathknell, but she felt it sounded true; she hated
him who had thus passed sentence upon her,
and she recognised that she was utterly
helpless and hopeless.


As she crossed the bridge she heard a dull
beating noise, and saw, by the light of a
lantern on the edge of the pond, a solitary woman
finishing her washing. Another hard worker,
completing her task out in this dreary evening!
well! if the work gave her wherewith to live,
she was happy; but Madeleine, who had no
work ? what was to become of her ?


That was the question she asked herself as
she sank down upon the stone steps of the corner
shop where she had lived with her mother, and
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 43 -->
let her wet, weary head lean back upon the
closed door.  
  
  
  " What will become of me ?"


The reader knows the situation of the shop,
bearing still the inscription of the Widow
Raynal's tenancy and trade upon its front; but a
few words are yet required to describe certain
details of the near neighbourhood. Opening in
front to the road, the shop, as has been already
stated, had its windows round the corner, upon
a muddy lane. This lane was bordered to the
right by a few very poor cottages, whilst on the
left the hedge, by which it was bounded,
enclosed the outlying portions of the property of
the Baron de Sauveterre. The estate was a
goodly one; and well kept, and skirting the
entire village of St. Martin to the back, spread
out to a considerable distance in the direction
of Blois. St. Martin had in reality but three
neighbours; the family of Clavreuil, right in
front, the Marquise de Beauvoisin and her
son Olivier, about two miles to the west; and
behind—Sauveterre.
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 44 -->

The owner and inhabitant of this last-named
chateau, was a very rich, very selfish, very
dissolute old man. His hospitality was splendid,
his cook a genius, his stable admirably mounted,
and the pleasures his welcome offered were
accepted on all hands without respect or esteem
being ever given in requital by his guests, or
claimed by him. A few days ago, it was said
that the noisy visitors who had filled the house
for several weeks had all departed, and the
baron himself was supposed to have left
Sauveterre for Paris.


Just as Madeleine Raynal laid her head back
against the shop-door, and avoiding to look over
the way at the light in Mother Perrot's window,
behind which might be glowering the sick
sabot-maker in angry mood, saw only the dense
darkness of the terrible future; just as the utter
helplessness of her position seemed to be literally
crushing her, the hoarse tones of the wheezy
old church clock struck six, and one second
after might be heard in the distance the ringing
of a bell.
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 45 -->

Madeleine listened, raised her head, and
seemed to be recalled to action by some sudden
inspiration or hope.


The bell rang on. It was the bell at the
Chateau de Sauveterre. Six o'clock. It was
the dressing bell; dinner was invariably served
at half-past six. But if dinner was thus
heralded in, the master of the house was
still there. Twenty minutes' stout walking
would bring anyone from St. Martin to the
back entrance, and among the domestics the
Widow Raynal had counted friends.


Madeleine rose to her feet, shivering to her
very bones with cold, stiff with wet.


\"If I were to try the Baron ? " murmured a
voice within her.


About an hour and a half later, when the
Widow Raynal's daughter stood, shrinking and
shuddering in the vestibule of the Chateau de
Sauveterre, her old, grey shawl thrown back
from her head, her hair brushed back from
her temples, and the fever hue of want,
excitement, and dread mantling her cheek and
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 46 -->
kindling Lher eye, a sudden blaze of light
nearly blinded her. A door opened wide, and
from the dining-room streamed forth the
radiance of lamps, and steamed forth the rich
odours of viands and wines. The meal was
ended, voices were heard in pleasant talk, and
on the threshold of the door, the hungry girl
had a vision of two old men, pausing for a
moment in their converse ere they crossed the
hall. They seemed to her enframed, as it
were, in splendour, as their two figures stood
out upon the background of gorgeousness and
comfort that was supplied by the illuminated
dining-chamber.
<!-- Leaf 59 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.  
  
  
  ALONE IN THE WORLD.


It would be difficult to find throughout France
a family more respected than the Clavreuils.
They were equally respected in the Province
and in Paris. There must really have been
nothing to say of them, for no one said anything.
As far as birth went they were probably
irreproachable; for the public voice never declared
that one of their recent forefathers had been a
lacquey, or a hackney-coachman. Their wealth,
too, must have been honestly got, for no envious
associate ever asserted that they had stolen it,
offering to give proofs of his assertions; and
the conduct of both husband and wife was
apparently excellent, for no friend, however
intimate, or of either sex, ventured to hint that
wdiat he orshe knew was sufficient to cause
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 48 -->
every door to be closed in the face of the pair.
In the absence of all assertion, hint, or surmise
to the contrary, it grew to be an established
fact that nothing could be more thoroughly,
absolutely respectable than M. and Madame de
Clavreuil.


This is a thing sufficiently uncommon in
France to be noteworthy.


The Comte Rene de Clavreuil was of an
ancient and distinguished, if not exactly
illustrious, family; which may be almost
exclusively held to imply that his ancestors had
formerly fought in the service of the king by
sea and land. M. de Clavreuil had no fortune
whatever; so that his sister (they were alone,
himself and Mademoiselle Clementine) had been
altogether without a dowry, and he had married
a great heiress, Mademoiselle de Lancour, of
equally good birth with himself.


Ten or twelve years after this marriage, and
when the sole child born of it was about eight
or nine years of age, it occurred to a bachelor
cousin of M. de Clavreuil's who, by the
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 49 -->
thousand chances attendant upon the subdivision of
landed property in France, had become
possessed of the family estate, to leave these
paternal acres to the man who had achieved wealth
sufficient to do them honour. At the death,
therefore, of his cousin, Ren6 de Clavreuil was
raised even more in his own esteem than in
that of others; for he was possessed of
territorial fortune in his own right, and became his
wife's equal, which is always a pleasant feeling
for a gentleman—and Count R6ne de Clavreuil
was a gentleman. He was decidedly not
brilliant, or in any way clever; never had said a
good thing in all his life, and was slow at
appreciating those said by others; but he was not
deficient in judgment or sense; was upright, just,
and what people who dread superiority of every
kind delight in denominating right-minded.
{empty}M. de Clavreuil's was one of those negative,
non-conducting natures, that may become the
centre of the most portentous events without
ever foreseeing them, or ever fathoming their
meaning even after they have taken place.  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  E
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 50 -->

Madame de Clavreuil, Count Rene's wife,
was, as we have said, a woman whom all good
Christians blessed. Her chief misfortune in
life was the having had for a father the
brilliantly gifted, notorious, and anything but
orthodox Vicomte de Lancour. It was not that
against the purity of M. de Lancour's honour
any breath had been ever breathed, or that any
human creature lived who could say he had
ever done an actual wrong. No; but his life
had been one of laxity with regard to religious
forms and ceremonies. Thought to be of
immense promise in the last years of Louis
XVIII., the young Vicomte was, with one
accord, thrown into the shade during the
disastrous reign of Charles X. The natural
consequence was, that he played a political part
under Louis Philippe, and shone forth lustrously
in the firmament of the monarchy of July.
His wife belonged to the purest Faubourg St.
Germain, and refused ever to be presented at
the usurper's court. His daughter was brought
up to believe that to pray for her misguided
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 51 -->
father was the limit to which tolerance could
be allowed to stretch; and when, shortly after
the Revolution of February, Re-action, as it is
termed, deliberately set in, Marie de Lancour,
then Comtesse de Clavreuil, grew accustomed to
hear her father spoken of by those she daily
lived with, as a man whose example was so
lamentable that his name should not be
mentioned unguardedly before young people. Herein
lay, then, the misfortune of Madame de
Clavreuil's life : she was brought up in fear and
trembling, and the narrowest prejudice and
most senseless resistance to all natural feelings
and tendencies were imposed upon her
authoritatively as a duty. Yes, a duty; for of what
derelictions and weaknesses, of what sins, nay
even crimes, might not the daughter and the
grandchild of the too-famous M. de Lancour be
naturally guilty? So that Madame de
Clavreuil, whom nature had made a thorough woman
—fond, kind, indulgent, sweet and fair in soul as
in face—had been, by the manner of her
education, transformed into a species of terrified  
  
  
  e a
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 52 -->
sentinel, her whole nature compelled into
inferiority by drill, determined to die at her post,
but for ever on the watch for the cry of qui
vive which was to call her into the fulness of

her repressive activity.  
  
  
  Between this thoroughly well-intentioned pair

—the father so upright, the mother so resolved
at all costs to do her duty—was brought up
Claire de Clavreuil, an only child, a wealthy
heiress,—a prize to be competed for by all
comers, and, oftener than one likes to register,
won and worn by the unworthy.


Poor Claire! two months had just passed
since we last saw her seated by her mother's
side in the drawing-room at Clavreuil, reading
the IAje of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, and
the plan of her life's drama was laid out.
Things were settled: Claire was to be married,
after Lent, to the Marquis de Beauvoisin, a
young man of great name and exceeding great
fortune—the Olivier who has been mentioned
in a previous chapter as encountered by
Madeleine, whom he piunounced ugly.
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 53 -->

Was this, then, what is styled a marriage of
convenience ? a marriage in which the fitness of
two fortunes, two social positions, two estates,
in short, is solely taken into consideration ?
No! you will be gravely told in France that
such marriages no longer exist. Neither do they
under the repulsive tyrannical form they used,
some seventy or eighty years ago, to assume.


There is no shutting up in convents,
now-adays, of recalcitrant girls; no violence, no
arbitrary rule, no cruelty, against which to
appeal to God and man; but the end reached
is pretty much the same. Men and women are
bound together who neither love, nor know, nor
care to know, each other. They are placed
between ennui (if not misery) and wrong, and
condemned to be obscurely heroic. This is the
reason why those who in France do their duty
are mostly so joyless. Virtue among French
people wears always a severe aspect, and they
who practise it (an immense mass), are never
cheerful.  
  
  
  Well, the friends of Claire de Clavreuil would
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 54 -->
tell you she had chosen her future lord; it was
quite true that before the Marquise de
Beauvoisin's proposals, on her son's part, had been
assented to, Claire was consulted, as they were
pleased to term it, by her parents. But, had
the girl thus consulted been so educated as to
make the consultation aught save a mockery ?
Had not Claire been taught, since her early
childhood, that to love was a sin, and that, after
obedience to God, blind obedience to all
superiors—parents, of course, standing foremost—
was the one saving virtue. How was it to
enter into this gentle-natured, well-trained
young girl's brain that she could possibly
venture to have a personal and independent opinion
about the man presented to her by her parents ?
When they said : " See what a mate for you
we have chosen!" adding for form's sake,
\"Will you accept him ? " where in the name of
logic and common sense was she to find the
courage wherewith to say No ? When the
momentous question was put to her, Claire said
Yes, as it was natural she should do.
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 55 -->

Visit succeeded visit at the Hotel de
Beauvoisin and at the Hotel de Clavreuil, and the
two mothers were esteemed happy among
women, and much homage was done at their
respective shrines, for, socially, much was
expected of them. Besides, they were held to
have set a good example, and they were
successful.


\"Are you really to have that wonderful set
of diamonds and rubies, Claire ?" asked of
Mile. Clavreuil, a young girl who had come
with her mother to felicitate. She happened
to be the only unmarried woman in the room,
which was full of busy-looking, inquisitive
matrons, so she monopolised Claire. " Are you
really going to have them ? " she repeated in a
whisper.


"You must ask mamma," replied Mile, de
Clavreuil, with a smile, and an imperceptible
shake of the head. " I know but little of these
arrangements; I leave all to her."


\"Leave all to her, my dear Claire!" retorted
the other; "leave all to her! Yes, of course
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 56 -->
one leaves all to one's mother as long as one
is only a girl; but, Heaven be praised! one
does not leave her one's diamonds when one is
married ! Why, all Paris is talking of them!
They say the necklace alone, with the three
rows of brilliants, is worth 400,000 francs ! "


\"Indeed ! " answered Claire, with the same
smile as before.


\"Now, do not put on that air of indifference!"
urged her friend, impatiently, " or I shall
believe you to be a hypocrite. No woman can
possibly be indifferent to such jewels; and if
you let them slip, it will only be said that my
cousin Olivier thought the price too high!"
(Claire winced.) " Don't allow that to be
hinted at, above all things ! Let your mother
manage anything else you choose, but take
care of the diamonds yourself; that is far too
important a matter! They say, you know,
that Olivier is in love with you; so seize your
opportunity—tell him you want the diamonds;
you'll get them now, my dear, and you won't
get them later."
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 57 -->

Claire winced again, and blushed scarlet,
and her wise young friend would have added
much more excellent advice, had she not been
summoned from the other end of the room by
her mother. She did not, however, depart,
before she had, in her loquacity, found means
of confiding to Claire that she had discovered,
through her mother's maid, that a marriage
was being negotiated for herself.


\"They think I know nothing," she found
time to say, " but I know all that goes on;
the only difficulty is about 150,000 francs more
to my dowry, which papa doesn't want to give
down; but," she added, with profound
sagacity, " that will be settled, because papa will
not lose such a name and position for the sake
of 150,000 francs; and, on the other hand, there
are deficiencies, too: age, health, &c.: so that
I have no fear at all; it is quite sure to be
settled! " and, with that pleasant assurance,
and the injunction not to utter a word, she
embraced Claire, and skipped off.  
  
  
  Claire stood musingly at a table, turning over
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 58 -->
the leaves of a book, Avhose pages, it Avas evident,
said nothing to her.


One lively old lady alone remained, and,
from under the lace ruches of her bonnet and
the dainty curls of her powdered grey hair, you
heard here and there words escape which showed
how deep an interest she took in the welfare of
the young bride.


\"Well," she murmured, as she took leave of
Madame de Clavreuil, "I am glad to think
there is so much inclination in the case. They
are both so handsome, so young, it would seem
a pity if there were not just a little bit of love
betAveen them." And the old lady (such a
pleasant, pretty old lady as she was) went her way.


The mother and daughter were alone.
Before resuming her habitual seat by the fire,
Madame de Clavreuil went up to the young
girl, who was still standing at the table, with a
vacant gaze fixed upon an open book.


\"My darling ! " said a soft voice, and a soft
maternal kiss was imprinted on the glowing
cheek of Claire.
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 59 -->

\"Mother," replied the latter, eagerly, " I
wish I might speak to you openly,—quite
openly."


Madame de Clavreuil fondly stroked the thick
tresses of her child's fair hair.


\"Do so, my sweet one," she rejoined; and
the two sat down before the fire; the girl
looking with an intentness at the mother, that the
mother did not at first notice.


\"Marriage is a solemn, a holy thing, mother,"
began Claire, with a sort of timid hurry. " Is
it not ? "


The Countess bowed her assent, and laid her
hand on the hand of the girl so tenderly, that
she seemed to invite her utmost confidence.


\"Mother," added Claire, " does one marry
to have diamonds and rubies, and to hear of
nothing, save barter and traffic, when one is
on the eve of such a chang.e ? Is it right that
these should be the thoughts of a Christian
woman ? "


\"My treasure," said Madame de Clavreuil,
with increasing fondness, " you must not lay
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 60 -->
too much stress on these details. I trace the
influence of Elise de Freteval in all this; but
Elise has been brought up to think too
constantly of her establishment in life. She is no
guide for you—"


\"Oh, mother ! " interrupted Claire, Avith
sudden energy; " if I am to marry, let me
forego these rubies and diamonds: let some
good be done Avith the money."


\"My own dear precious child," exclaimed
the mother, drawing her daughter's head
towards her, and warmly kissing her, Avhile tears
gathered in her eyes.


But Madame de Clavreuil had not heard the
first words: " If I am to marry," and Claire
inferred from her tenderness more than Avas
meant.


\"AVe can talk it over with the Abbe
Gendrin," continued the Countess, " and perhaps
some portion of the sum may go to found some
institution. With the Avealth you will have to
dispose of, so much good can be done."  
  
  
  Claire Avas silent. She had, evidently, more
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 61 -->
to say, but was troubled hoAv to say it. Never
had she seen her mother so fond, so
encouraging.  
  
  
  After a pause—


\"Does it seem to you quite right," she
recommenced, " that this great step should be
taken, this long, life-engagement contracted so "
—she hesitated—" so lightly ? "


\"Lightly ! Claire ! " echoed Madame de
ClaAnreuil, with undisguised astonishment.
\"Lightly ! What do you mean ? "


\"I mean, mother," answered the girl, in a
lower tone, " without any affection on either
side."


\"Affection comes later," observed the
Countess.  
  
  
  " But if it never comes ? " suggested Claire.


\"Dearest," responded the mother, less
warmly, though still kindly, " these are
questions which it does not befit a young girl to
discuss."


\"But if the girl's happiness be destroyed?"
urged Claire; "if her heart be broken? if—"
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 62 -->

\"Claire ! " exclaimed Madame de Clavreuil,
hardly believing what she heard. " Claire ! "


But the girl was now clearly carried beyond
her usual timid reserve by a purpose. She
pressed forwards, seized both her mother's
hands, and, with every sign of uncontrollable
agitation—


\"Mother! " she pleaded; "let me once
speak to you from my heart—once, before all
is over, and irretrievable. Mother! must I
marry M. de Beauvoisin ? "


Madame de Clavreuil sprang from her seat,
and stared Avith amazement at the child she
seemed to know no longer. Had the voice
woke no echo in her own heart ? Was she
struggling, or was she only frightened ?


At first, her surprise found no utterance.
She stood mute before the sudden revelation
of things she had never guessed. Perhaps
Claire argued favourably of this silence, for,
pressing fonvard with growing energy, broAV
and cheek burning, eyes flashing, and quivering
lips—
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 63 -->

\"Oh, mother, mother ! " she cried; "do not
put me from you! Think that I am your
own, only child; think how young I am, and
how hard it is to forego all happiness. Help
me, mother ! Listen, and let me tell—"


Madame de Clavreuil started back, and,
holding her daughter at arm's-length—


\"What is all this absurdity ? " she demanded,
sternly. " Are you raving? What is this
folly ? Probably the result of those
abominable English novels, which Mrs. Griffiths ought
never to have permitted you to read. Let me
never hear again words of this kind.
Happiness, indeed! Happiness consists in doing
your duty; and the one duty of a girl is
obedience to her parents."


In speaking as she did, Madame de Clavreuil
was simply following the teaching she had
received. Her heart would have prompted
her to listen, but she dared not.


Claire felt her case was hopeless. She
released her hold upon her mother's hand. The
flush subsided upon her face, the lips closed,
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 64 -->
and she gazed at her mother more in wonder
than in reproach. For a moment she seemed
trying to fathom the cause wherefore she was
thus repulsed. And then the gaze was lowered,
the sweet head drooped upon the breast, and
Claire glided noiselessly from her mother's
presence.


Madame de Clavreuil fled to her own room,
locked the door, cast herself upon the
PrieDieu, burst into an agony of sobs and tears,
and, clasping her hands, murmured bitterly—


\"Oh, Father in Heaven ! when will my weak
nature find it easy to do what is right ? "  
  
  
  Meanwhile, she was doing what was wrong.
<!-- Leaf 77 -->
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  A REAL WOMAN.


It has been mentioned that M. de Clavreuil
had a sister. Her history was one not wholly
without a parallel, but not common in France.


Clementine de Clavreuil had no dowry. She
was beautiful; but the consciousness of her
superiority of birth and inferiority of fortune
had given to her beauty a certain austere air,
and to her whole bearing an excess of dignity,
which is often, among French Avomen, the
consequence of a position such as hers.


At seven-and-twenty she Avas still unmarried,
as was also her brother, who was her elder by
two or three years. Clementine came to the
persuasion that she hindered her brother's
establishment, and that she wTas regarded as
a drag upon him. She accepted the hand of  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  t
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 66 -->
a strange husband for a girl so nobly born.
She married a certain M. Beaudouin, a
shipowner of Bordeaux, thirty years older than
herself, very ugly and mean-looking,
enormously rich, and the best hearted and most
honest of men.


Madame Beaudouin esteemed, honoured,
revered, her humbly born partner in life, and
AAdien he spoke of her, Avhich was rare, for the
subject seemed too holy to be commonly
handled, his vulgar face Avas illumined by an
internal light that ennobled it.


Poor M. Beaudouin! his was really an ignoble
semblance. He was short, and he shuffled
along as he walked. His features were
ungainly, his complexion of a fierce red, and his
hair, which stood bolt upright, and which no
brush could flatten, Avas so snowy, that, at a
little distance, all you discerned of this man
was a patch of white and a patch of scarlet.
It was ugliness unqualified, aggressive.


But the soul within Avas a gentle one, and
that his wife thoroughly kneAV, or she would
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 67 -->
never have married him. He lived five years,
during which he was wont to say solemnly, he
had known Paradise upon this earth. He
died, leaving everything he possessed to his
widow, with power to leave it at her death to
whomsoever she chose. He had no relations
nearer than cousins three or four times
removed, whom he scarcely knew, and who were
all rich.


Madame Beaudouin was, therefore, at
thirtytwo, one of the most enviable prizes in Paris.
Rich to a quite unusual degree (people talked
of two or three hundred thousand francs a
year), and beautiful exceedingly. But Madame
Beaudouin was not to be Avooed, for it was
rumoured that Madame Beaudouin was won.


What was believed at M. Beaudouin's death
-was this:—


Among the very large circle of guests to
whom the hospitality of M. and Madame
Beaudouin was always freely extended, one
was especially remarked. Raymond de Varades
was a captain upon Lamoriciere's staff, an  
  
  
  F 2
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 68 -->
African, a young man whose exploits were in
every mouth, and whose fame filled all Algerian
bulletins. But the purity of his character was
as famous as his courage, and all men held up
Raymond as an example.


His admiration for Madame Beaudouin was
undisguised. Why should he descend to hide
such sweet pure worship ? It could but honour
him and her. But a day came when the fair,
serenely still countenance of Clementine beamed
with such a divine brightness, that the merest
looker-on felt her to be transfigured. That
day Raymond de Varades returned to Algeria,
although he had still tAvo months more leave
at his disposal. The glorious light burned on,
and waned not, upon Clementine's lovely face

—the light as of a sun that, once risen, would
never set. She walked amongst men, Avrapt as
it were in a serene ecstacy, and her purity as
much as her loveliness compelled their homage.


There Avere no petty subterfuges, no mean
concealments, the love shone forth in all its
grandeur, shielded only by the glory of its own
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 69 -->
innocence. No envious breath ever dimmed
the fair fame of these severed lovers, but they
lived on unsullied in the world, which against
a really sublime Truth never rebels.


For tAvo entire years M. de Varades never
returned to Europe, and then M. Beaudouin died.
It was rumoured that on his death-bed he had
told his wife how he had watched her loyal
guardianship of his honour, and how his last
moments Avould be rendered happier if he felt
cure of her marrying M. de Varades.


However this might be, Raymond did return
to Paris a couple of months after M.
Beaudouin's death, and remained there a few weeks,
during which time he was a constant visitor at
the Clavreuils. Madame Beaudouin then
decided that the proper mark of respect due
to her deceased husband was, that M. de
Varades should return to his post, and only
revisit Paris when the full term of her
mourning should have expired. Her slightest wish
Avas to him a law, and he did return to Algeria.
When the second year should be complete, he
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 70 -->
was to take a conge of a year; and when the
third year after M. Beaudouin's death had
expired, Clementine was to become Madame
de Varades. What was time, what was
distance to them ? she argued, in the strength of
her purity, and of her love ! Sure of her heart's
Infinite, she counted on the Infinite in time;
and losing sight of the lesser chances of
existence, walked on recklessly in her passionate
faith.


The same god-like ardour seemed to inspire
Raymond; for during eighteen months the
record of his deeds of impossible daring filled
all newspapers. And then there was a silence
of some days, and a small telegram appeared
in the Moniteur, dated Blidah, in which it was
stated that the Commandant de Varades had
been killed by a fall from his horse. It was
very short—only two lines; but it was enough,
as had been the pebble over which, in the
implacable irony of fate, Raymond's horse had
stumbled, on the steep path descending into a
mountain defile.
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 71 -->

{empty}M. de Varades Avas absorbed in the inward
contemplation of his future happiness, when
he was hurled several feet in advance over his
faithful Arabian's head, and he had passed into
eternity before awakening from his dream. He
neither spoke nor breathed more.  
  
  
  All was over.


There is a mystery wThich the Avorld never
fathoms in all feelings which the Avorld esteems
excessive, that is, which go beyond its ken.
Madame Beaudouin did not seem to suffer in
the particular way in AAdiich the common run
of men and women suffer. For some time
after Raymond's death, she lived absolutely
alone, seeing no living creature, neither brother
nor sister-in-law, nor any of those who were
her nearest in affection or blood. And then,
when people saw her again, there was no
perceptible change in her, they thought. She was,
perhaps, a shade paler, and more silent than
before, and subject to fits of abstraction, during
which a faint reflection of the divine light
which had once illumined her, and was now
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 72 -->
extinguished, seemed again to pass over her
features.


The vulgar, who believe in one set form of
mourning, never guess at the holy illusions of
insupportable grief; never understand that
excess of love—and pure love—admits of no
separation, and really does vanquish death.
Where love rises so high, and where the
oneness it creates is so absolute, what do you
know of its secrets or of its consolations?
Look on yon Avidow, and try to penetrate the
cause of her long and placid endurance of life

—of the ordinary life of those around her.
The cause lies therein, that there has been no
severance of the two Infinites : Love has been
the victor over Death : the beloved one may be
dead—yes; but gone from her—no.


And thus Clementine lived on, and no one
ever grew to be nearer to her. Probably hers
was that solitude where one is least alone;
it is certain that, although she mixed with her
kindred, she never more partook of their life,
or divided hers with them. Fourteen years
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 73 -->
passed over and brought no change. A seal
seemed set on Madame Beaudouin's whole
being, which forbade any other impress being
made; she was, to all appearance, what she
ever had been, and nor time nor emotion
seemed to touch her.


This premised, Madame Beaudouin's activity
had apparently but one
mainspring—benevolence, the charity which ministers to all needs,
and supplies the moral as the material wants.
All suffering turned to her, and was allayed.
And yet few out of those whom she helped and
consoled felt thoroughly at home with her.
She was, as it were, something angelic, not
familiar.


\"Is that woman, after all, thoroughly
insensible?" asked once a young member of the
Jockey Club of his neighbour; " impervious to
all impressions? without any nervous system
at all?"


The man he asked it of was the notorious
Marquis de Moranges, the last Mousquetaire,
the hardest liver going, the man of whom,
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 74 -->
when he was under thirty, old Talleyrand, a
week before his death, had said,—  
  
  
  " C'est un grand viveur que M. deMoranges."


This man turned round, and, surveying his
youthful neighbour, half in pity, half in scorn—


\"Don't trouble yourself about Madame
Beaudouin," observed he; adding, with involuntary
warmth, " if a real, true woman ever existed,
there she is. But bah! mon cher, with that
you have nothing to do—nor I either."
<!-- Leaf 87 -->
  
  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  OUT IN THE SUN.


Claire was her aunt's god-daughter, and
tenderly attached to each other were aunt
and niece. Perhaps Madame de Clavreuil
might have feared the memory of her
sisterin-law's romantic past, had it not been, first,
that Clementine's outward manner of taking
that past had been decided by the world to be
utterly unromantic; and, secondly, that worldly
prudence forbade any apprehensions directed
towards a relative who had an enormous
fortune to leave.


Some persons affirmed that this was the only
sign of calculation ever shown by Madame
Beaudouin, and said that, in order to ensure
to herself the frequent companionship of her
niece, she was in the habit of keeping
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 76 -->
perpetually before her brother's eyes the power
she had of leaving her fortune as she listed.


It Avas no wonder that Madame Beaudouin
loved her niece, for a lovelier specimen of
womankind than Claire has rarely graced our
earth. Two circumstances had rescued Mile.
de Clavreuil from the narroAving influences of
her education. One Avas the unceasing
contact of Aunt Clementine; and the other, the
admirable good sense and kindness of her
governess, Mrs. Griffiths. This lady was an
English gentlewoman of reduced means;
thoroughly English, and thoroughly a
gentleAvoman; true, honest, of unswerving devotion
to the Right, but gentle, meek, and tender,
and who, though a Protestant, and used to
social habits so different, had found means to
bring up this Catholic French girl so
irreproachably, and to do her own duty by her
pupil, and her employers, so perfectly, that,
whilst Claire rewarded her with a love sincere
and deep, the whole Clavreuil family regarded
her with unlimited respect.
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 77 -->

Mrs. Griffiths had formed Claire's mind and
edified her character on large and solid bases,
and Mile, de Clavreuil was not only, at eighteen,
an accomplished, highly educated girl, she was
a straightforward, noble, duty-loving lady, who
knew Truth's value, and was, what those of
her sex too rarely are, safe.


But what had made Claire a woman was the
contact of her aunt, and the intense curiosity
her aunt's history inspired in her. How she
knew anything at all about it was a marvel,
for her mother naturally, even in her OAvn
thoughts, never referred to it; Mrs. Griffiths
was too conscientious to hint at a subject that
her pupil's parents wished unspoken of; and
Claire had never, in her whole life, been ten
minutes alone with her own or the Countess's
maid. Yet still she kneAV, and knew correctly,
the whole outline of the tale, had pondered
over it constantly, and eagerly longed to know
its intimate details.


When Madame de Clavreuil, in obedience
to what she deemed her duty, had so
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 78 -->
peremptorily stopped all approach to a compromising
confidence on her daughter's part, Claire
instantly made up her mind to appeal to Madame
Beaudouin.


Breakfast was no sooner over the next
morning, than Claire sallied forth Avith Mrs.
Griffiths, and was left by the latter at the door
of her aunt's boudoir. These visits to Aunt
Clementine Avere of such frequent occurrence,
that no note Avas taken of them, and it was
usual for the governess to leave her pupil Avith
Madame Beaudouin, while she herself thus
obtained the freedom of her own movements
for a couple of hours or so.


Aunt Clementine was seated at a Ioav
table Avriting, when her niece entered the
room.


Everything in that room bore Avitness to the
refined tastes of its inhabitant. There was not
one atom of gilding in it, except what lay upon
the frames of choice pictures; nor a single spot
of gaudy colouring, incapacitating the eye for
seizing the soft harmonies of the whole. The
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 79 -->
walls were of carved Avood, white, or pale grey,
upon a grey of a deeper shade, disposed in
panels; the style was that of Louis XVI., but
the genuine Louis XVI. of 1780, not what is
palmed off upon the ignorant under that name.
The draperies and hangings were of old
Beauvais tapestry, bordered by broad bands of
that deep brown-red called garnet-coloured in
France. Wherever the eye rested, there was
something beautiful or rare to look upon:—
China, bronzes, enamels, marqueterie tables,
vases, flowers—but all in their proper place—
not one there where the other ought to have
been. All was fitting, nothing stiff; all told of
homeliness and every-day life, without a trace
of untidiness.


And how fair was she still who presided over
the place. At forty-seven you would have
given her fifteen or twenty years less than her
age. She had the fine outlines of the Clavreuil
face, famed for its classic beauty; but the lustre
of the eye, the light of the smile, the
transparency of the delicate, smooth complexion,
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 80 -->
seemed to come from some mysterious source,
and savoured as it Avere of immortality. Her
dress, of a very pale saw-coloured poplin, was
at once severe and picturesque, the upper part
fitting Avith exquisite precision, the lower
flowing into rich swelling draperies, as in a
Venetian picture. Over the glossy waves of her
chestnut hair lay a fauchon of old point-lace,
meeting under the chin, and encircling the
sweet face of the wearer with a most graceful
setting.


It calmed you, in spite of yourself, to look
upon Aunt Clementine, and the serenity of her
Avhole being seemed as though it might calm
almost any inward storm.


But ere she had released her niece from the
embrace in which she, on her entrance,
enfolded her, Madame Beaudouin saw that all was
not right with Claire.


She resumed her own seat quietly, looking
with tender earnestness at her niece, who at
first bent down to caress a greyhound who was
sleeping before the fire, and then drew a low
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 81 -->
stool upon the hearth-rug, and seated herself
at Madame Beaudouin's feet. The latter
stooped towards her niece, and untied her
bonnet and put it away upon a chair.


\"You are not likely to have visitors, aunt,
are you?" asked Mile, de Clavreuil.


"I never receive any one, as you know, till
after four," was the reply.


\"I have so much to say," added Claire,
hurriedly.


Madame Beaudouin put her arms round the
girl's neck, and kissed her forehead.


\"Aunt," resumed Claire, in a low and almost
Avhispering tone; " you must promise to listen
to every word I have to say."


\"My darling," replied Madame Beaudouin,
fondly; " you know that the thought of you
and your welfare is what chiefly attaches me to
life; but you know, also, what my principles
are as to any interference between parents and
children "


"Aunt!" interrupted Claire, raising her
sweet head and looking Madame Beaudouin  
  
  
  G  
  
  
  VOL. I.
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 82 -->
fixedly in the face. " I know all you are going
to say, and I know all you have been to me
always; Ave have both of us done our duty—
you have never interfered, and I have never
rebelled; but now a moment is come wdien
you must interfere." Madame Beaudouin's
air Avas a very grave one, but she remained
silent.


"Yes, aunt," added Claire; "I have come
to you, in order that you may repeat to my
father what I am going to say to you. I am
not asking connivance from you, aunt, I am
asking help; but help openly given. I see
what you would object; you think my mother
ought first to have been applied to, aunt dear.
I have tried that, and it failed. My mother
either does not, or will not understand."


Madame Beaudouin sighed, and looked
away into the flame-pictures of the fire.
Claire put out her tAvo hands, took her aunt's
in hers, and earnestly gazing at her, " Do you
think," she asked, "that what my father and
mother are doing with me is right, or honest,
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 83 -->
or Christian ? It does not make it better to tell
me that every other girl is treated in the same
way. So much the worse. If I am to marry
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, feeling towards him as I do,
I should have been differently brought up. In
that case you have clone me harm, and Mrs.
Griffiths has done me harm, for you have both
of you taught me to be true, to be upright, to
be honest; but if I am to be all that, I cannot
marry M. de Beauvoisin."


"My Claire," interposed her aunt, "you
should, at all events, have been at once frank
with your parents. This marriage has been
negotiated," (Madame Beaudouin hesitated
slightly as she pronounced this word) " talked
of for at least three months, and it is only now,
when all is settled, that you object. Your
parents would have a right to say you have
deceived them."


\"To that accusation I can only answer that
I did not know the man," rejoined Mile, de
Clavreuil. " 1 did not rebel at the first notion
of marriage, because it seems to be the common  
  
  
  G 2
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 84 -->
fate; but since I have knoAvn M. de
Beauvoisin, I feel I ought not to marry him. I am
acting dishonestly if I do not say to him
that I neither like nor esteem him; and if I
marry him after I have said that, Avhat will our
union be?"


"What is your great objection to Olivier?"
demanded, gently, Madame de Beaudouin.


\"Everything," retorted her niece decisively.
\"He has neither intelligence nor heart; the
only things he honours I despise; Avhat I (and
you) reArerence is to him a dead letter; and
the superiority Avhich people press upon me as
conclusive, makes me blush with shame, for it
is only the superiority of his fortune. Does it
satisfy you, Aunt Clementine, that I should be
sold?"


Madame Beaudouin evaded the glance that
accompanied these words.


"Claire," said she, "that vieAv is a Avrong
one, for you are very rich; and, Avith the
addition of my fortune one day, you will be
nearly as rich as Olivier."
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 85 -->

The girl looked scrutinizingly at her aunt,
almost doubtingly.


\"You must not desert me," she continued,
Avith singular energy. " You know your hold
on my father. You must come to my aid, and
prevent this marriage." And lowering her
voice, and fathoming the very depth of her
aunt's soul with her eyes, " You dare not refuse
me," she murmured.


There was no perceptible change in Madame
Beaudouin's fair and tranquil face; but, putting
her hand on Claire's mouth,—


\"Hush," said she, as she felt what a memory
was stirred; and then, after a pause of a few
seconds, " My child," she continued, " the love
of one human being for another is the holiest
thing on earth. The mere absence of love is
only a negation. In our time, and in our
world, there is so little deep or true feeling, that
perhaps it is scarcely justifiable to renounce a
marriage because you fancy you do not yet like
the husband proposed. In your case, darling,
it is merely a question of dislike;" she saw
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 86 -->
something in her niece Avhich made her add,
"is it not?"


Claire's lips quivered, and tears gathered in
her eyes. She no longer looked steadily at her
aunt—her glance wavered.


"My own sweet child," whispered, softly
and pityingly, her aunt.


Claire glided from the stool on which she
was sitting, and, putting her arms round her
aunt's waist, knelt clown, burying her face in
Madame Beaudouin's lap.


In the close embrace expression Avas
confused, and it was in answer to an almost
inaudible question that the words,—


\"My cousin Victor!" dropped from Mile, de
Clavreuil's lips.


Her position prevented her from perceiving
the darkness of the shadow Avhich fell over
Madame Beaudouin's countenance.  
  
  
  At the end of a moment or tAvo,—


\"Darling," said the latter, " it would be next
to impossible to persuade your father to consent.
You knoAV the dread, the horror everyone in
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 87 -->
your family has of your mother's father, and
of the name of Lancour, and all the glory
won by Victor's father goes for nothing Avith
them."


\"I know it all," said Claire, raising her
head, "and I know hoAv unjust, and foolish,
and wrong it all is; for one day in London
(when papa took us to the Exhibition) I fell
upon M. * * * * * *'s history of this century
in France, and found out what other people
think of my grandfather, and what a noble
citizen he was, and what a patriotic minister;
and as to Victor's father, the General, he was a
hero."


\"But all that will not prevent the determined
refusal to consent. General de Lancour, your
mother's brother, was extravagant, and spent
largely. Victor's fortune is small."


\"So much the better," retorted Claire,
radiantly. " I am rich; and, as you say,
aunt dear," added she, with naive selfishness,
\"your fortune makes of me a great heiress;
that is why you have a right to interfere—
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 88 -->
that is why all depends on you, aunt dearest;"
she added, beseechingly, "let me owe the
happiness of my life to you. What makes
you look so sad and so severe ? am I so very
guilty?"


"Sweet darling child!" said her aunt, "I
must know all; has Victor himself had a part
in this dream ? Are you agreed together ?
You must tell me all, Claire."


The girl hung her head, and bashfully
recounted the feAv nothings which to her pure
sense seemed as evidences of love : a hand she
once thought he had pressed, a flower he had
given and she had treasured, a word, a look—
a girlish dream, fondly interpreted.


"And that is all?" gravely asked Aunt
Clementine.  
  
  
  Claire turned pale.


\"All ? " echoed she, in a frightened accent,
"does it seem to you so little ? "


"Thank God! My Claire," said Madame
Beaudouin, solemnly, and with eyes full of
tears, "it is nothing! "
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 89 -->

Mile, de Clavreuil sprang to her feet, and
with a resentful air and tone—


"Aunt," she cried, " you have not kept faith
with me, you are in league with my father and
mother, and plotting my misery with them;
but my mind is made up: I will not marry
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, whatever scandal may
ensue."


\"Oh ! Claire ! My darling, listen ! " replied
Madame Beaudouin, with mournful
earnestness, " your cousin Victor cannot marry—
cannot love you. He is fettered by one of
those chains—"


\"Some infamous creature, whom he despises
already! " burst forth Claire, tossing her head
proudly. " One of those incidents in a man's
life which his wife cannot even condescend to
hear of!"


"Alas, alas ! " resumed Madame Beaudouin;
\"a lady like yourself, Claire—a young and
beautiful woman—misguided, Aveak, and, at
last, guilty ! She left her husband, and has
been, for three years, in all but name, your
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 90 -->
cousin Victor's Avife — he cannot abandon
her."


\"And he loves her ? " repeated slowly Mile.
de Clavreuil, who, except that she was of an
ashy paleness, seemed to have recovered her
usual dignity of demeanour. " She probably
was married as my mother wishes me to
marry;" this Avas someAvhat bitterly said. " So
Victor loves her? "


\"I firmly believe he does," replied, sadly,
Madame Beaudouin; " and, although the
knowledge Avounds you now, my child, be merciful,
and think that to the unfortunate who has paid
for Victor's love with all she possessed, Avith
her AAdiole self recklessly, his love is the one
only compensation."


Claire walked to the window and looked out.
It was one of those soft, mild, violet-bringing
days of February, that are not uncommon in
Paris. The sun shone brightly, and the sky
was evenly blue.


The windows of Madame Beaudouin's room
(the house stood in the Avenue Gabriel)
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 91 -->
commanded a view straight across into the Champs
Elysees. There were carriages passing to and
fro, and horsemen, and loungers on foot, and
the whole scene wore that peculiar air of gaiety
that the first smile of early unexpected spring
imparts. The sun was everywhere; on the
broad spaces of the great thoroughfare out of
doors, on a Claude Lorrain upon the wall of
the apartment, on the broad leaves of the
plants in the jardiniere, and on the red-broAvn
arabesques of the grey carpet.


Claire stood full in the broad, bright ray,
when she Avent to the window; and, in the
warm, balmy atmosphere of that room, in which
everything told of wealth and comfort, and in
the golden radiance which wrapt her round as
she stepped into it, Mile, de Clavreuil, I assure
you, felt as desolate as did the sloppy,
draggletailed girl whom we have seen struggling along,
one rainy night, on the road between Clavreuil
and St. Martin.  
  
  
  That evening, Claire announced to her
<!-- Leaf 104 -->
  
  
92 LOVE THE AVENGER.

mother that her resistance was at an end, and

that she was ready to marry the Marquis de

Beauvoisin; but she would answer no questions,

and returned her mother's embrace somewhat

coldly.
<!-- Leaf 105 -->
  
  CHAPTER VII.  
  
  
  TWO MOTHERS.


Fourteen months passed by, and Mile, de
Clavreuil had been married more than a year.
The wedding tour of the Marquis de Beauvoisin
and his wife had been made to Italy, and
they had passed the whole summer in Rome;
or rather, whilst Claire remained stationary
there, her husband made short journeys from
place to place : to Ravenna or to Naples, to
Palermo or to Pisa. People said Madame de
Beauvoisin was wrong; that to stay in Rome
during the hot months was insane for a
woman in her interesting condition, and that
the Marquis ought to prevent it; but Rome
seemed to exercise some invincible attraction
over Claire, and between her husband and
herself there was apparently such an
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 94 -->
imperturbably good understanding, that it Avould
have been difficult to imagine even a
discussion arising between them.


The winter after their marriage was passed
by the young couple at Nice; and it was only
towards the middle of April that they returned
to Paris.


Very late one night there was a great noise
and bustle at the Hotel de Beauvoisin; heavy
gates were opened and swung-to, doors AA^ere
slammed, lights moved behind all the Avindows,
there was a tramping of feet, and a tempest of
voices of every possible tonality and accent.
The master and mistress of the house had
returned from abroad with a numerous retinue.


"Of course, you have seen them?" said a
lady who came at five o'clock next day to visit
Madame de Clavreuil.


\"I went at tAvelve o'clock to-day, immediately
after breakfast," was the reply.


"I Avent at nine—considerably before," was
the rejoinder.  
  
  
  The lady who came to visit Madame de
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 95 -->
Clavreuil was no other than the Marquise de
Beauvoisin, the mother of Claire's husband, a
very remarkable person.


Mademoiselle de Moranges had brought to
the man to whom her hand was destined one
of the largest fortunes possessed by any of the
(then) great heiresses in France. This fortune,
joined to her husband's, she had found means,
by her clever management, to augment in a
very considerable degree; for she was, as
her brother was wont to denominate her, the
first man of business in Europe; and M. de
Beauvoisin, soon convinced of this, retired
from the exercise of any control whatever over
his property, and left all in the hands of his
extremely sagacious spouse.


This prize notary, as some one else called
her, was early left a widow, and she at once
took the necessary measures for preventing her
son from in any way meddling in her plans of
government. She had him educated strictly
according to the method, every detail whereof
she laid down; and she had him, at the same
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 96 -->
time, carefully kept out of the Avay of the gains
of our age; and morally, she put him by, as
it were, so that the fresh air of the soul's life
never reached him. When he attained to
man's estate he was mentally musty—the
imvard man was Avizened. Outwardly he was
remarkably handsome, stronger and healthier
than the ordinary run of men of his age in
France, better mannered, and politer. He was
a tolerable shot, rode Avell, spoke little and
lazily, took no genuine pleasure in anything,
and adhered scrupulously to all the external
forms of religion.


Madame de Beauvoisin was usually quoted
as a mother who had performed wonders in
the education of her son. It Avas esteemed a
model education.


One of this lady's qualities was early rising.
She got up at five o'clock winter and summer,
and never stayed late anyAvhere, ignoring
theatres, and eschewing balls, Avhich enabled
her to get through an unheard-of quantity of
business.
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 97 -->
  
  Madame de Clavreuil smiled as she said,—


\"Was any one up at Claire's when you
went?"


Madame de Beauvoisin sneered as she
answered,—


\"Of course they were all still in bed, but I
have seen them since. Do you find Claire
altered?" she added, fixing upon Madame de
Clavreuil a searching glance.


Searching, was in reality the most
appropriate term for Madame de Beauvoisin. In
her sharp chin, and pointed nose, and above
all, in her piercing black eyes, there was
something strongly detective. She was said not to
have been ugly in her early youth; she was
certainly plain now at sornevvhat over
fortythree; for an attack of small-pox some dozen
years ago had, Avithout precisely marking,
muddied her complexion, and nothing relieved
or softened the sharp outlines and hard
features of her face. She was not devoid of
what the French call distinction, to which
her most intimate friends declared she had no  
  
  
  VOL. I.

<!-- Leaf 110 -->
  
  LOVE THE AVENGER.

right, seeing that her mother, the late Madame
de Moranges, was Mile. Letourneur, the
daughter of Louis Simon Letourneur, the
regicide member of the Convention, born and
brought up as a bailiff, and grown rich by the
most mysteriously nefarious practices.
However, as far as the exterior went, the Moranges
blood had neutralised the blood of old
Letourneur, and although Madame de Beauvoisin
might be an unpleasant, she Avas not a
vulgarlooking woman.


Unpleasant she Avas, and as she sat there,
irreproachably dressed, SAvathed in stiff, black
brocade, and a Avhite bonnet, elegantly austere,
surrounding her coal-black hair,—as she sat
there, looking through Madame de Clavreuil,
you might have fancied she was a member of
the old Venetian Council of Ten in disguise,
or a collateral descendant of the Spanish Grand
Inquisitor under Phillip II.


"Do you find Claire altered?" she repeated,
for her question had not been answered directly.
\"I don't mean in looks—but in manner."
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 99 -->

"I perceived nothing extraordinary in her,"
replied the Countess, " I thought her looking
a little thinner, a little paler perhaps than
Avhen she left, but her confinement would
account for that—no," continued Madame de
Clavreuil, as though she had reflected well on
what she was saying, " I don't think I
perceived any change in her manner; she was
always very quiet, you know, and of course
marriage makes a great difference, and I have
not seen her since her wedding-day."


\"Nor I either," resumed the Marquise, with
a malicious twinkle of conscious superiority in
her eyes, "but I see the difference in her.
I tell you, my good friend, that Claire has
acquired such an amount of confidence that
she will try to go her own way, and that it
will be a hard matter for you and me to make
her go ours."


"Ours?" echoed the Countess in
astonishment, " but I don't Avant her to go my way. I
don't want to lead her. When one marries
one's daughter, one ceases to direct her."  
  
  
  H 2
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 100 -->

"That is," interrupted Madame de
Beauvoisin, "that you regard the establishment of
one's children in the light of a deliverance—
most persons do—I don't; and I repeat it, if
I am not mistaken—which I never was in my
life—we shall have a hard time of it to make
Claire go our waj'."


\"But I really have no way in particular,"
objected Madame de Clavreuil gently.


The Marquise surveyed her all over Avith a
glance of contempt Avhich she did not see.


\"Indeed ?" she retorted. " Well, I have. I
do not intend that the magnificent fortune I
have given Claire the enjoyment of shall be
mismanaged."


\"But surely Olivier will see to that," observed
Madame de Clavreuil.


"Olivier!" exclaimed the Marquise, with a
smile of disdainful surprise. " Well, I should
have given him a strange education if, having
me for a mother, he should dream of manasinc
his own affairs; but it would be a pity that
his wife should make any silly attempts to
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 101 -->
meddle in what does not concern her, or
imagine that she can exercise a will of her
own—" (Madame de Beauvoisin said this in a
tone of semi-compassionate warning more
disagreeable than any overt menace)—" it would
really be a pity. Her son's fortune must be,
when he comes of age, the double of what
Olivier's now is, and it is my determination to
make it so; but I mean to set to work my own
way, as I have always done hitherto."


\"Talking of that," interposed Madame de
Clavreuil, rapidly, and as though she were glad
to turn the conversation into another and less
personal channel, " what do you hear of this
extraordinary liaison of your brother's?" We
shall see soon that this refers to Madeleine
Raynal, whom we left looking for charity in
the mansion of Baron de Sauveterre, and who
is now befriended by the Marquis de
Moranges. "Is it true that he commits the follies
that people say?"


Madame de Beauvoisin's brow darkened, and
an unquiet light flashed from under her eyelids.
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 102 -->

\"What do people say ? " she echoed; " that
he has bought the diamonds and rubies that I
prevented Olivier from buying for his wife!
Well, it is abominable, no doubt; but if that is
all, it must be put up with. Men have clone
worse than that, and yet left the object of their
lavishness to die of starvation. Maurice was
not by nature sentimental. The only tiresome
part of the business is, that he has changed all
his habits. I never see him noAv—do you?"
she said, very abruptly.


\"Rarely," replied the Countess; "you know
he never was much with me; but I will tell
you who sees more of him than any one—my
sister-in-laAv ''


\"Sainte Clementine ! " ejaculated impatiently
the Marquise. " That is just one of those
anomalies I never can comprehend; the Avay in
which sinners and saints congregate together
is to me inexplicable; the indulgence the saint
has for the sinners, and the attraction the sinner
feels for the saint, is beyond my philosophy—
but so it is; you see it every day in our society."
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 103 -->

\"Do you know how your brother himself
explains it?" inquired Madame de Clavreuil,
smiling; "he says it only happens Avhen the
saint is an unmistakeable saint, and the sinner
an unmistakeable sinner."


"Well," rejoined her friend, "I will accept
Maurice's canonisation of Clementine so long as
I may count upon his own total impenitence."  
  
  
  The Countess started back in horror.


\"Dear friend," resumed Madame de
Beauvoisin, rising to go, and laying one finger of
her pearl-grey glove upon Madame de
Clavreuil's arm, " our neighbours' vices are the
salvation of us righteous people. If Maurice
has not thoroughly perverted that woman wrho
is with him now, he is no longer the illustrious
man he was; and if he has done so, she will
easily be detached from him, and he Avill be as
easily reattached to some one less remarkable
■—for remarkable I believe she is—and in that
way my grandchild will inherit what
legitimately belongs to him, which I am resolved
upon it he shall do."
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 104 -->

\"Where did he pick up that dreadful
creature?" inquired Madame de Clavreuil, Avith a
shudder.


"The Sphinx, as they call her?" replied the
Marquise; " well, there lies the great mystery.
No one knows; he tells nothing; and all at
once she appeared and was famous. It is said
old Sauveterre knows all about her. However,
rely upon me, my dear, the Sphinx shall not
deprive my grandson of his inheritance."


And with that the Marquise departed, leaving
Madame de Clavreuil thoroughly uncomfortable
and uneasy.


Both these women had had precisely the
same education; it had narroAved both; but
the narrowness had hardened one, weakened
the other, making of the one a dangerous, of
the other a useless person.
<!-- Leaf 117 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  THE HUSBAND.


A feav days after the conversation we have
recorded between the Marquise and her son's
mother-in-law, Olivier was seated in his own
apartment, on a very low chair before the
fire, one foot on the fender, the other on the
marble column Avhich supported one side of
the mantel-shelf. More distant from the fire
another man was seated on a rocking-chair.
It was the Count Dupont de Laporte—the
Henri whom we have already seen in
company with Olivier at the Chateau de Clavreuil,
when Madeleine Raynal passed out by the
stableyard, and was called ugly by one of the
friends, and curiously beautiful by the other.
It would be too much to say that the two
friends were now talking together, they were
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 106 -->
smoking in concert, nothing more, excepting
only that the man on the rocking-chair Avas
evidently occupied in observing his companion.


There were no flowers in the room, or it would
have had all the appearances of a woman's
abode, so richly was it furnished, and so
numerous were the knick-knacks of all species Avhich
lay about. Neither were there any books—
not one—but there was a piano, the exterior
whereof was marvellous; it Avas of the most
complicated inlaying, every precious wood that
is to be found in the two hemispheres
furnishing its quota to the flowers and leaves which
tAvined themselves in garlands on its surface.
Over the chimney-piece was a blind of the
most costly oriental workmanship, hiding the
eternal piece of plate-glass from which no
salon in the modern dwellings of Paris seems
fated to escape. The luxury of the furniture
was distressing; blue and silver brocade
everywhere, on the sofas and chairs, and on the
window-curtains and portieres. The carpet
was a couple of inches thick, like moss, and
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 107 -->
had taken twelve months to make; it cost a
fabulous sum. Clocks of all forms and dates
were to be seen upon the walls, and watches
of every description were to be found upon the
tables. They all went, though they did not all
of them strike. M. le Marquis kept a servant
on purpose to wind them; he was a man of
reliable character who drank only water. The
ceaseless ticking of these chronometrical
engines made a kind of atmosphere, a kind of
eternal hum, not soothing, like that of busy
insects on a hot day, but unbearable to people
of nervous susceptibilities.


There were, as I said, no flowers, but all the
perfumes of Arabia, and of everyAvhere else,
were by turns burnt in that chamber, helping
to thicken the air and to make it unwholesome.
False taste was everyAvhere, the only healthy
and gentlemanlike (because the only genuine)
thing in the whole over-scented, over-crowded,
over-heated place, was the smell of the cigars
the two men were smoking. After attentively
surveying his companion for some time,
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 108 -->
the man on the rocking-chair broke the
silence.


"And so," said he, "with a slight tinge
of irony in his tone; " Italy did not lay
hold of you with teeth and claws, my good
Olivier."


\"Well—you know—really," replied M. de
Beauvoisin, with a kind of involuntary
embarrassment, " it is so uncomfortable; so little
like Avhat one is used to at home; the cookery
is dreadful, the theatres are odious, and the
houses, with their great enormous empty rooms
and galleries, make one wretched—there is
nothing modern about it all—nothing of our
time! But tell me, Avhat do you think of
Claire, now that you have seen her."


The Count Dupont de Laporte took his cigar
out of his mouth, and looking full at Olivier,—


\"What do I think of her ? " he repeated,
gravely. " Why, do you suppose one judges
one's friend's Avife as one Avould a horse ? "


\"Well! I'm sure I don't knoAV," replied the
other, " but I should have imagined there was
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 109 -->
but one way of judging anything, and that was
by looking at it."


\"If that was all, it would be easy enough in
this case," observed Count Dupont, " for
anything more lovely than your wife can scarcely
be conceived; as far as seeing goes, you forget
I saw her once before—at Clavreuil, at the visit
I paid there with you just on the eve of my last
journey to the East;—but tell me, Olivier," he
added, somewhat abruptly, " are you satisfied
with the outAvard beauty only ? have you gone
no deeper than that ? "


The Marquis fidgeted about on his chair,
bent forward, threw the ashes of his cigar into
the fire instead of into the old Sevres dish at
his elbow, and did not apparently know Avhat
to reply.


\"Mind! Olivier," resumed Count Dupont,
"I did not broach this subject; it is far too
delicate a one in my estimation (and a
thousand times more so since I have seen the
Marquise), for me to have ventured to hint
at it."
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 110 -->

{empty}M. de Beauvoisin deliberately laid down his
cigar, put his two hands behind his head, and
leant back on his chair in what seemed very
like excessive lassitude.


\"My dear Henri," groaned he, " it is for that
reason that I asked you Avhat you thought of
Claire : for to say the truth I don't knoAV what
I think. I'm very much puzzled, and
sometimes almost alarmed."


\"The Avorld says you live happily together,"
remarked Henri, " is that not so ? "


\"Perfectly so," was the rejoinder, " it is
impossible to agree better than we do. Claire's
temper is the sweetest in the world, and we
have never had even a discussion since Ave
married; she ahvays does everything I Avish,
and I never heard her make an objection to
anything."


\"And yet you are puzzled and almost
alarmed?" observed his friend, Avith a curious
expression of countenance. " Ah—you don't
know how she will get on with your mother,
you know your mother's spirit of domination,
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 111 -->
and you do not know the real character of
your wife."


\"That is exactly the case, Henri!"
exclaimed M. de Beauvoisin, Avith a sudden
expression of relief at having his perplexities
so clearly explained to him. " The truth is,
that I feel as if I did not know Claire at all! "  
  
  
  " Why should you?" demanded Dupont.


\"Well, I suppose when people are
married—" suggested Olivier, " I suppose they get
to know each other."


\"Do you ? " retorted his friend, in rather a
bitter tone. " What! you fancy the marriage
ceremony is a manner of Open Sesame to the
whole nature of a human creature, who till
then was a stranger to you! You think that,
without your giving [yourself any trouble, the
woman who has the honour to be your wife
must necessarily put you in possession of the
secret springs of her whole being! There's
the dishonesty again, for in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred, you put her in possession of
just nothing at all."
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 112 -->

\"No! my dear fellow, it is not that,"
objected the Marquis, confusedly. " I don't
mean to exercise any superiority over anybody
—I never did—it is not my Avay; I leave
Claire free as air; but somehow Avhen people
are married they ought to get to know each
other."


Henri Dupont got up, walked to the
chimneypiece, set his back against it, and gazed down
at his friend, who was still lolling back in his
chair, with his two hands under his helpless
head.


"So it is not even the lordship of the
husband that you assert," said he, with a
compassionate smile. " You fancy that by the
simple virtue of the marriage act two people
who ignored each other totally the clay before,
are on the morroAv to know each other
thoroughly, and be able to count upon each
other in all emergencies; humph! an easy
process to be sure ! but, my good Olivier,—
does your wife know you ? "  
  
  
  " But there's nothing to knoAV in me!"
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 113 -->
answered the Marquis, innocently. " I'm not a
mystery. I'm like everybody else."  
  
  
  Count Dupont laughed.


\"And Madame de Beauvoisin is not exactly
like everybody else," murmured he.


"There is her defect," propounded the
Marquis.  
  
  
  " Eh ? " demanded Henri. " What ? "


"I say there is her defect," repeated
Olivier.


\"Well, let it pass : there is her defect. Have
you anything in common, Olivier, with your
wife? I mean any idea or opinion, or
occupation, or habit?"


Olivier sighed and scanned the ceiling with
a troubled air.


\"Well, I'm sure I don't quite know," he
replied; "but I don't think Ave have much.
Claire reads a great deal, and she has a
reputation for being a great musician; but the
music she likes would drive me distracted, and
the music I enjoy, I, somehow, don't venture to
propose to her to come and hear. Why, now,  
  
  
  VOL. I. I
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 114 -->
since we came back I've been four times to La
belle ESlene, and, I can't explain why, I have
never offered to take her with me; perhaps
I'm afraid of her Avanting to take me to the
Conservatoire. Then, again, she don't care for
horses,—knows nothing at all about them."
And suddenly springing from his seat, " Look
there ! " he exclaimed, drawing up the oriental
blind over the mantel-piece, " Look what
my mother arranged for me during our
absence!"


Count Dupont turned round, and through the
plate glass surveyed a magnificent stable, Avhere
twelve horses were to be counted, each in a
wide loose box.


\"Princely!" he remarked; " but I'll bet any
money there's not one of those animals that any
real horseman and true lover of horses Avould
be likely to rave about."


"May be!" rejoined the Marquis; "but
such as they are there's not one that cost under
seven thousand francs; three cost twelve
thousand, and one tAventy ! "
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 115 -->

"Again I say, princely!" repeated Henri.
\"And unluckily, then, your wife doesn't care
for horses ? "


\"No! and I don't really know how we shall
get on!" (It seemed his pet expression.)
\"My dear fellow," he exclaimed,
disconsolately, " life is so tiresome ! the day is so hard
to get through! Suppose, now, that Claire
should not get on with my mother ! Suppose
we should be having scenes, you know! what
would become of me ? if this were added to all
the boredom of life, it really would be too
much; and I confess that one or two slight
things I have remarked alarm me. My dear
Henri!" this took the accent of a fervent
appeal, " do become a friend of Claire's; try
to make her out; you know you are so clever!
and make her feel that my mother must not
be opposed."


\"A pleasant task, truly ! " retorted Henri
Dupont; "to mediate between two women,
one of whom is your mother! I will put my
life in danger for you any day, my good fellow,  
  
  
  i 2
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 116 -->
but subject myself to the feminine cross fire you
kindly propose, this I beg to decline."


Before M. de Beauvoisin could follow up his
request, three or four young men were ushered
into the room, and Count Dupont de Laporte,
after exchanging greetings with them all, Avas
making for the door.


\"Don't forget, Henri," cried Olivier, " that
you promised Claire to take a place in her box
at the opera to-morroAV evening."
<!-- Leaf 129 -->
  
  CHAPTER IX.  
  
  
  LA TRAVIATA.


It was an extraordinary representation that
took place that night at the opera; one of those
entertainments for which people take tickets as
they do in an excursion train, whizzing and
Avhirlins; through the domain of art as through
many lands, getting a vast deal too much of
what is indifferent to them, and little or nothing
of wrhat they may really care for, all which
considerations will never present the tickets
from being taken, and the places filled. Un
heard of attractions had been grouped together
on this night, and after Joachim, and Vivier,
and Bottesini—(it had even been said that the
Abbe Liszt would at a certain moment appear
in the orchestra-stalls, in his white Dominican
robes ! —a manifest invention !)—after all this,
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 118 -->
and a great deal more, the Avhole was to Avind
up with the Traviata, sung for this once by
Christine Nilsson.


The few hundred individuals who compose
what is called all Paris, were in a compact
body at the opera on this occasion. The
merest stall cost forty francs. Hoav was it
possible for any one aspiring to a reputation
for fashion to avoid being seen there ?


The box taken by the Marquis de Beauvoisin
was on the first tier, between the columns.
The two front seats Avere occupied by Claire,
and an acquaintance of hers, Avhom we have
seen once before, Mile. Elise de Freteval, now
Duchesse de Varignan. Her husband, a man
of past sixty, Avas a near relation of Olivier's;
had, for t\vo months filled the post of
ambassador from France to one of the Northern
PoAvers, just before the fall of Charles X., and
was looked up to in his OAvn set as a political
luminary. He was now a martyr to
rheumatism, and never accompanied his wife upon the
evening expeditions, whereof she undertook a
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 119 -->
plurality every night. M. de Beauvoisin had
so marked a preference for the society of
Madame la Duchesse, that he was for ever
suggesting to his wife to invite her, which Claire
invariably did, with the utmost apparent alacrity.
It was remarked that whenever Madame de
Varignan was present, Olivier seemed at his
ease—to say he was lively would perhaps be
an exaggeration; but he did not sleep, or even
yawn; folloAved the conversation without visible
effort; and, in short, it was generally supposed
that the Duchess knew how to draw him out,
though what the result of this operation might
be, remained a mystery to all save the initiated.
At all events, Claire seemed pleased that her
husband should have an agreeable companion,
and accordingly Madame de Varignan was a
constant guest at the Hotel de Beauvoisin. The
Marquis called her cousin, she sometimes called
him Olivier, for she had a free-and-easy way
with her, and she said he was the best-natured
fellow in the world. Between the two ladies
there was no intimacy. The Duchess
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 120 -->
characterised Claire as pedantic and dry. Claire
never spoke of Madame de Varignan at all.
It was not her custom to speak of people, but
rather of things; nor was she, of her nature,
talkative.


Hoav I wish I could paint Claire de
Beauvoisin as she appeared to those AAdio saw her
on the night in question! No lovelier sight
can be imagined. It Avas not the fairness of
her features, the harmony of every line in her
figure, or the perfection of the colouring, that
so charmed you in her; it was, united to all
these, something else undefinable, something
that seemed to shine through her from within.
There lay, as it Avere, a bloom upon her soul.
There floated around Claire such an
atmosphere of purity, that Avhen she entered a room,
you thought you scented the breath of
fieldflowers. The sensation she brought to you
was as of fresh air. And yet, though all was
healthy, pure, fresh, and full of youth, all was
not joyful in her. Claire rarely laughed; but
her sweet, calm face, seemed ahATays about to
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 121 -->
light itself up with a smile. The expression
of her eyes was a serious, if not a sad one.


As the two feminine occupants of the box
between the columns took their seats, it would
have been hard to say what made the difference
between those two women so enormous. They
were not glaringly unlike each other. Madame
de Varignan was a little stouter and more
developed than the Marquise; her features were
rather more marked, her hair a trifle darker;
but the general outlines, the cast of the head
and face, and a certain air, appeared to a
casual observer to be nearly the same in both.
The impress of the time, which forces a certain
degree of resemblance on those who live
together in the same centres, had set a similar
mark on Elise and on Claire, but the similarity
vanished at the first glance of real scrutiny.
Madame de Varignan, in spite of all her fashion
(and she was most fashionable), had in her an
unmistakable element of coarseness, whilst
Claire was refinement itself.  
  
  
  The Duchess was magnificently dressed in
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 122 -->
white satin, trimmed Avith marabout feathers
and lace, and besides flowers and plumes, the
plaits and curls of her hair were looped up with
strings of pearls, Avhich she took care you
should know were all real. Pearls Avere all
over her, and, like hail-drops, rested on neck,
shoulders, arms, and head. From the mere
milliner and dressmaker point of vieAv, I am
bound to say that Madame de Varignan's
toilette was a success'; but of the profound
art and exquisite taste with which
Frenchwomen used to combine their external attire,
there was not a trace.


To the fluffy, fussy, furbelowed costume of
the Duchess, Claire opposed a simplicity that
Avould have been excessive had not the result
been so charming. On her neck rested just
one string of large pearls, fastened by a single
diamond that flashed like a star. In the thick
heavy tresses of her fair hair, not a jeAvel or a
flower was to be discovered—she wore the
crown Nature gave her, and disdained all
foreign ornament. Her dress, of white gauze,
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 123 -->
trimmed with Alengon-point, floated round her
cloud-like.. She needed nothing beyond. Gems
and flowers were alike superfluous, for she
herself was the flower and the gem.


Between the acts of the opera, visitors
thronged into Madame de Beauvoisin's box,
for Claire's beauty divided the attention of the
house with the heroine of the stage. It was
her first appearance before the great fashionable
public since her return to Paris, and she excited
as much curiosity as admiration.


Count Dupont de Laporte, who had
accompanied Olivier and his wife to the theatre, was
occupied in ansAvering Claire's questions
touching divers celebrities, who were to be
discerned, Avhether in stalls or boxes.


"I wonder," said she, "who that hand and
arm belong to. Look; in that box just in the
direction of the stage boxes. You can only see
an ungloved arm and hand—the curtain of the
box covers the person they belong to — but
there is a bracelet of rubies and diamonds
upon the arm that is absolutely royal."
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 124 -->

Henri Dupont set his glass at the box pointed
out, and,—


\"That," said he, " is M. de Moranges', your
uncle's, box."


"Yes," added the Duchess, fixing her glass
upon the same spot; "and that bracelet is a
part of the ruby and diamond parure Avhich
ought to have been yours, Claire. Now you
see where those sort of things go to."


Claire blushed deeply at the indelicacy, as
she thought it, of Madame de Varignan, and
drew back slightly behind the red silk curtain
of the box.


"Those sort of things," she repeated, "are
perhaps better placed as they are. I do not
worship jewels; but," she added, " I thought I
saw my uncle in the orchestra stalls just now."


\"So you did," rejoined Count Dupont. "I
met him just after the first act, and he told me
he was coming here."


\"Why, I should hardly fancy M. de
Moranges would have the bad taste to parade in the
face of all Paris in the same box Avith the
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 125 -->
Sphinx, on an occasion when everybody who
belongs to society is sure to be present."


The Duchess made this remark as though
she were giving Claire a kind of lesson.


The door was opened, and the Marquis de
Moranges entered, accompanied by another
man, some twenty years younger than himself.


"Victor!" exclaimed, gladly, M. de
Beauvoisin, holding out his hand to the new comer,
with what, for him, was an unusual degree of
animation. " What an age since we met.
We've been home nearly ten days, and I have
not seen you yet! "


Having shaken hands cordially with Olivier,
the new comer advanced a step, and bowed to
the two ladies in front, extending his hand
first to Madame de Beauvoisin, then to the
Duchess, who greeted him Avith overt, nay,
almost noisy delight. He then turned again
round to the Marquise, put out his hand a
second time, saying,—


\"My dear, dear Claire! my dear little cousin,
what a real pleasure it is to see you back once
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 126 -->
more amongst us;" and, Avith a smile of frank
good humour and frank regard, " how's the
baby?" he asked, bending doAvn towards the
young mother. "You know I'm not over
given to care for those imps; not at all learned
in infants; but your baby, Claire, that is
something perfectly apart from every other in
the world. I don't feel that the wee thing is
only my second cousin, but decidedly my
nephew, and my nepheAv I mean to call him.
How is my nephew, Claire ? what is his
name?"


\"Pierre," replied the Marquis. " Come and
breakfast to-morrow, and you shall see him,
Victor. I knoAV nothing about such things;
but my mother says he is splendid, and just
what a Beauvoisin ought to be."


All that Victor de Lancour had been saying
to Claire was said with such genuine fondness—■
he was really so glad to see his cousin, and
talk to her of her child—that he did not perceive
with what indifference she met his advances.
She replied to him by a few words, but never
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 127 -->
once looked at him, keeping, on the contrary,
her glass riveted to her eyes.


\"What's that you're saying ? " demanded,
suddenly, the Marquis de Moranges of a
fairhaired young gentleman, Avho was standing
behind him, talking to Henri Dupont.


\"I was saying how divine the Nilsson is in
the part of Violetta."  
  
  
  " Hein ? " retorted M. de Moranges.


\"Well, he said diA-ine," remarked Count
Dupont, laying his hand good-naturedly on the
youth's shoulder; "that is a term permitted in
the vocabulary of the rising generation."


\"Undoubtedly," sneered the Marquis; " for
it is a generation glorying in anomalies, and
taking nothing as it is. If a man plays a
violin you say it is like a flute; if a ballet-girl
dances well you say it's like music, or painting,
or something else; and here, again, with the
Nilsson. You call her divine—granted; I've
no objection whatever. I dare say she is
divine, angelic, anything you choose; but she's
not the TraAuata."
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 128 -->

\"Naturally," observed the Duchess, " that is
so like you men; you are such realists—so
wanting in all delicacy and in all genuine
refinement of taste where women are
concerned."


\"I beg your pardon, Madame la Duchesse,"
retorted the Marquis de Moranges; " there is
no man Avho does not appreciate true delicacy,
true refinement; but Ave know the secret of life
in its various phases, and don't like to be
cheated. The general public likes to be
interested, moved, impressed by the incidents
in a Traviata's life, than Avhich, generally,
nothing can be less interesting; and to obtain this
result it has recourse to a deceit—it fashions to
itself a creature that never existed—can't exist."


\"How moral my uncle is!" murmured
Olivier.


\"Moral! " echoed M. de Moranges, shaking
his head; " well, never mind; I have nothing
against Traviatas, neither am I an unbeliever
in a real affection in a woman's heart, but I
cannot tolerate a wolf being taken for a lamb,
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 129 -->
or a lamb for a wolf—I will not be taken in if
I can help it. Now the Marguerite Gautier of
the Nilsson is false; it is somebody else; it is
the violin that is a flute. The Marguerite
Gautier you are so charmed with, is a pure,
well-brought-up, honest young lady, who has
had what is called an adventure—she has been
unfortunate in love—but she is not a Dame
aux Camelias."  
  
  
  Count Dupont nodded his assent,


\"What! you, too, agree with M. de.
Moranges ? " exclaimed the Duchess.


\"I can't help myself," answered Henri;
\"what he says is true."


\"Well, what is it then that is wanting in the
Nilsson ?" pursued Madame de Varignan,
turning round so as to confront the talkers at
the back of the box.


The three men looked at each other
significantly; and, with a cynical smile,—


\"Just what I cannot explain to you, Madame
la Duchesse," replied M. de Moranges, bowing
low.  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  K
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 130 -->
  
  " Nonsense ! " was the retort. " One can

hear anything."


Claire lowered her glass, and, after a passing
glance at the Duchess, cast an involuntary look
at Victor. He looked grave and was silent.


\"I will tell you Avhat is wanting in the
Nilsson's Dame aux Camillas" volunteered
Henri Dupont; "it is the red mouse that
escapes from Gretchen's lips on the Brocken;
Goethe, who knew all the things in man's life,
didn't omit that."


"Gretchen is no Traviata ! " interposed the
fair-haired youth, Avho seemed well read.


\"Isn't she, my boy?" asked M. de Moranges.
\"We Avill discuss that together twenty years
hence. For the moment I adhere to what M.
Dupont has so ingeniously expressed-; the red
mouse fails the Nilsson; listen to the cold,
crystalline purity of her virginal voice! there is
no red mouse there."


"But, after all, what is the red mouse?"
demanded the Duchess, imperiously; " and
can't one do without it?"
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 131 -->
  
  The curtain drew up for the last act.


"Let us get back to our stalls," said the
fair-haired youth, anxious to lose not a note of
his divine prima donna.


\"The red mouse is the sign of the species,"
declared Count Dupont, as he made way for
{empty}M. de Moranges to pass.


\"And there is no Traviata without the red
mouse," added the latter as he left the box,
and bowed respectfully to his niece, and with
a curious expression of countenance to the
Duchesse de Varignan.


There was ere long a great croAvd on the
staircase and in the vestibule, and people
talked with each other as in a draAving-room
while waiting for their carriages. All at
once,—


"Who is she with?" asked a voice in the
group of men close to where Madame de
Varignan and Madame de Beauvoisin were
standing.  
  
  
  "With old Sauveterre," was the reply.  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 132 -->

"Of whom are they talking?" whispered
the Duchess to Olivier.


\"Look up the great staircase," he replied;
\"don't you see? "


"The Sphinx! Avell, the creature is
singularly handsome to-night — handsomer than
usual," added Madame de Varignan. " Did
you see her last Sunday at the races ? "


\"No; this is the first time I have ever seen
her," and the Marquis gazed intently upon the
object of discussion in question.


\"She had on such a love of a dress,"
continued the Duchess; " a sort of cloak—pure
eighteenth century—in pale blue satin,
bordered Avith old lace. I've had it copied, only
mine will be crimson embroidered with gold."


Madame de Beauvoisin, who had been all
this time determinedly talking of music, and
comparing Italian and German masters Avith
those around her, turned quickly round at
these words, and surveyed Madame de
Varignan with a look of indescribable surprise. It
was almost haughty in its mute indignation.
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 133 -->

Towards the middle of the grand staircase
stood the person every one was more or less
busy with. There were but few people behind,
the crowd lay beneath her, and at each instant
gave passage to men, famous in the annals of
mere fashion, who pressed forward to speak to,
and be recognized by her. Of the strangeness
of her aspect there could be no doubt, but was
she beautiful? She produced the effects of
beauty—and that sufficed.


She was of middle height, and apparently
Avell-proportioned, though the furs and lace veils
which wrapped her round, rather hid the lines of
the shoulders and neck. Her dress, of deep red
velvet, was gathered up in heavy folds in front
and held by an ungloved hand, unhealthily
Avhite like unto ivory, and on the wrist whereof
blazed the rubies and diamonds Avhich had
excited Madame de Varignan's envy. The hood
of a lace veil she wore had fallen back and left
her head uncovered. It was a singular face
that met your eye there, and one that explained
her surname of The Sphinx. The complexion
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 134 -->
was so pale that the masses of fair hair did not
confound their tints Avith the hue of the skin,
but seemed to surround the alabaster mask with
a mounting of shiny gold. The mouth, the
chin, and form of the jaw, all this was, if not
faulty as to outline, suggestive of unpleasant
ideas; the nose was long, thin, and rather
pointed; the eyes, dark, and deep set, as stars seen
at the bottom of a well, and, drawn sharply over
them, the stern, straight line, not the arch, of
an implacable eye-brow. When you had once
alloAved your gaze to rest on this woman's face
it was not easy to detach it, curiosity held you
captive, as at the approach of whatsoever seems
mysterious.


"Hoav Avell that diadem of rubies and
diamonds suits her," said Olivier.


\"Yes," murmured the Duchess, pursuing
her old idea; "you have seen that diadem
before now, my dear—handled it—and if you
had chosen, it would have been a marchioness's
coronet," and she gave Olivier's arm a malicious
little tap with her fan.
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 135 -->

There was a movement in the crowd, and
several people went to their carriages. This
brought the Sphinx into close proximity with
the groups below.


"Yes! she certainly is beautiful," said M.
de Beauvoisin, loud enough to be heard.


The Sphinx scanned the speaker of the
words with a singular look.


\"How that red velvet suits her," he
continued; "she is superbly dressed."


\"What aptitudes you men of our day have
for millinery and dress-making! " said Madame
de Varignan, half-contemptuously.


The swaying of the crowd brought the red
velvet robe just now in contact with Madame
de Beauvoisin's pure white dress. Claire did
not draw back, or seem offended. There was
no dread of contamination in her air, no scorn,
nor curiosity, but the deepest compassion in
the tone in which, turning her head aside, she
said—  
  
  
  " Poor creature!"  
  
  
  Had the exclamation been heard ?
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 136 -->

A pink flush spread for one second over the
pale features, and from the dusky caverns of
those strange eyes, a glance shot forth that
Avent Avandering over all those around.


\"There can be no doubt about her beauty,"
vouchsafed M. de Beauvoisin.


When the crowd had nearly dispersed,
\"Olivier," Avhispered Count Dupont, laying
his hand on his friend's arm, as they stood for
an instant near each other, " I know her ! that
is the girl you and I once saw in the
stableyard at Clavreuil. She is to be recognised out
of a million! "


Olivier shrugged his shoulders in disdain of
the ridiculous supposition.
<!-- Leaf 149 -->
  
  CHAPTER X.  
  
  
  MADAME CLAUDINE.


There are some things concerning which the
world preaches ignorance as a proof of purity.
Yet no one denies that science has been the
cause of the gradual disappearance of some of
the worst physical evils man inherited from his
fall. Leprosy was not cured by averted heads
and delicate cries of Don't let's look at it! And
not the corruption only, but the complicated
mechanism of modern society has engendered a
moral leprosy which no one denies, which every
one says ought to be cured, but which an infinitely
small number alone will consent to study. And
where so many hundred thousands of our
fellowcreatures are concerned, where so many lives
are Avrecked, so many souls imperilled, and
such incurable misery entailed upon the
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 138 -->
innocent, nay, upon the unborn, it is but fitting that
some knowledge of the cause of evil should be
acquired. It is not from the sin itself that we
turn; on the contrary, there never was a time
in which, throughout Europe, it was so much
talked and written about. Neither do avc
recoil from certain incarnations of the sin when
they are sufficiently magnificent. Just the
reverse : for in that case our best and purest—
our mothers, maidens, AAn'ves—jostle the sinful
in the crowd, and speak of them as of any
other sight, which it may be fashionable to
see.


Neither have Ave any repugnance for the
death-beds of the sinners. When it comes to
that, with or Avithout repentance, Ave all of us
fancy ourselves in earnest, and, pretty nearly all
of us, do our best.


But all this assumes the evil itself as a sort
of necessity. Now, that is not enough. It is
not enough to rail against the sin in its
splendour, as is the delight of powerful preachers,
nor to rejoice over the conversion, in death, of
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 139 -->
the penitent sinful, as is the wont of sweet
preachers :—what is required is some knowledge
of the incitement to sin, some clue to what may
lead to the prevention of it. At this Society
shrugs its shoulders, averts its head, says, it
probably can't be helped, opines, above all, that
the less said of it the better, and, worst of all,
implies, by all its acts and all its arguments, its
intimate conviction of the irresistible charm of
Evil.


We are learning every day, but our learning
is lame and halt, and our acquisitive forces
don't pull steadily together. We have pretty
well mastered the fact that disease is not,
per se, but means the incapacity of resistance
of the diseased. There we stand still.


Evil has no charm, per se, but feeds itself
into power upon the incapacity of good. Vice,
which we moderns are daily more and more
bowing doAAm to as necessary, is a negation.
Of itself it is not. Strengthen Right, and there
would be no wrong. These are the truths we
seem to avoid.
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 140 -->

Science and Charity are our only helpmates;
—not the bare science of statistics, that satisfies
empty heads with the mere arithmetic of
demoralisation; nor the bare charity of almsgiving,
that satisfies empty hearts at the mere cost of
coin—but the Science which teaches Avhy and
Avherefore Evil is resorted to as a refuge;
and the Charity which furnishes the means
for achieving a larger, stronger capacity of
good.

£_•


Madeleine Raynal, whom Ave have last seen
in the company of M. de Moranges, Avas, when
at the opening of this tale she asked for help
from the Baron de Sauveterre, utterly helpless.
This is a Avord often lisped out in the pretty
parlance of our draAving-rooms, and, like many
others, profaned by those Avho Ioioav nothing of
the awful expression they are playing Avith;
but AAdio among the croAvd Ave are accustomed
to live Avith ever realises Avhat it is to be
completely helpless,—that is, Avithout bread Avhen
hunger tortures, Avithout warmth Avhen cold
numbs, without another human being on whom
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 141 -->
to lean when all power of self-support is giving
way? No food, no roof, no raiment, no
sympathy ! we none of us knoAV what that means,
and we all of us, everyday of our lives, talk of it as
if we did. We invariably condemn as if Ave
possessed a mathematical certainty of the
adequacy of the powers of resistance to those of
attack, which is what we never do. We talk
of Temptation, and Weakness, and Vice, and
Virtue, as if they were one and immutable,
whereas they are individual and for ever
varying.


We have all of us been tempted, as it is
inevitable we should be, being men; we have
many of us succumbed; and where we have
been victorious, we knew at the time what the
victory cost us—but we forget it. Integrity is
a hard word for poor mortals; and the thing
itself is a hard thing to be conceived or
compassed : for, with his ever-warring body and
soul, his latent instincts and factitious wants,
his ignorance, his vanity, and the perpetual
disproportion betAveen his ideas and his
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 142 -->
circumstances, it is next to impossible that a
mortal should be whole; yet Integrity,
forsooth, is what we imperiously demand from
miscellaneous mortals, not one of whom
resembles his felloAv.


We know, in reality, of no temptations save
those we have yielded to, or withstood. We
knoAV what has tempted us—nothing more, and
thereupon we judge. We knoAV pigs are not
tempted by pearls, but we don't for that think
the higher of the pigs; and we do think the
higher of ourselves because Ave are not tempted
by garbage; which is foolish and unjust.
What is above or beloAV, or in any way beyond
us, escapes us. We neither like to believe in
the exceeding purity which Evil attracts not,
even through the medium of curiosity; nor do
we choose to recognise the total defencelessness
of those who have literally Avithin their grasp
not one single arm wherewith to resist evil.


Try to catch a pike Avith that diamond crown
—before which I should tremble for the integrity
of our friend the Marchioness—he passes it by;
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 143 -->
but grub up out of the mud a big, bloated
worm, and offer it him, and see how, drunk
with desire, he swallows it, and is caught.
Of course you despise the pike for being
so low down in the scale of creation;
but he is true to his fish-nature, and gulps
down what to him, is life, being devoid of the
lights which would show him you are bringing
him death. And how many are the thousands,
nay, hundreds of thousands, of our fellow
creatures who are left so destitute of all help
and all comfort, so steeped in ignorance, so
unarmed in the face of Avrong, that to the low
level of their life-development, the fat worm of
the pike is the true temptation ?


Is this their fault ? must it always be so ?
and is there no possible prevention of sin ?


I again say it: on the night when Madeleine
Raynal found herself in the vestibule of the
Chateau de Sauveterre, and felt on her cold,
wet face the warm steam of plenty issuing
from the open dining-room, she was craving for
food, shivering with cold, and frightened out of
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 144 -->
  
  her ordinary senses by the notion of Denis Per
rot's violence. She Avas thoroughly helpless.  
  
  
  When Madeleine Avas helped, she Avasthankful, that was all. She Avent but once more to
the sabot - maker's. It was on the morrow.


She went to say good-bye, and to say she
should never come again. They asked no
questions, the mother or the son; neither as to
where the girl had been the day before, nor
Avhere she would be the day after. It is true
the mother Perrot looked wistfully, pityingly at
her; but inquiries Avere forbidden by the uneasy
glances of her son, which seemed to seal her
lips. When Madeleine shook hands with Denis,
he muttered something about gratitude, and
meat and Avine to restore his strength, which
Madeline ansAvered by giving him the five-franc
piece she had herself received the night before
in the stable-yard at Clavreuil. The sick
workman took it eagerly, thought it, in one and the
same second, enormous, and then less than it
might have been, and modified what began like
a leer of knoAving contempt into what ended as
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 145 -->
a smile of obsequious deference. The sick
sabot-maker was the first who saluted the girl's
good luck.  
  
  
  The widoAv Perrot kissed her in silence.


I am bound to say that there was nothing
particular to observe in Madeleine after the
great change in her fate—I mean nothing as far
as philosophy or psychology went. She was,
alas! morally and psychologically
unsatisfactory, for, in fact, psychologically and morally,
she was not.


At first she was not enraptured, either by her
fine clothes or by her luxurious abode (a hotel
in a busy street in Paris), or even by the varied
aspects of Paris itself. She was in no wise
ashamed, or remorseful, or conscious of
degradation. She was conscious of having been
saved from starvation, as people who have been
saved from shipwreck, and from the danger of
preying upon their own kind, are conscious of
the rescue of life. She was, as it was her
nature to be, dull, and her mental perceptions
Avere slow and dim.  
  
  
  L  
  
  
  VOL. I.
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 146 -->

At first—pray forgive me for recording it—
at first, what she did was to feed herself! She
ate flesh, and game, and fowls, and truffles
(which she did not like), and drank Bordeaux,
and felt well; and, after the long, healthy
slumbers of famishing eighteen, woke, to eat
again, and found it pleasant.


Remember what this girl's life and
education had been, and see in what measure the
genuine comprehension of good had been
cultivated in her—how far it was possible that she
should understand the admirable exhortations,
Avhereby you would induce her to forego her
present comforts and luxuries rather than stain
her soul.


Her soul! Avhat do the teachings she has
received teach her of that?


And the fault is the same everywhere.
When mothers in the high social spheres tell
you of the freedom their children possess to
choose their partners in life, they unconsciously
equivocate, for the natures of their children
have been fashioned in such a guise that what
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 147 -->
fails them is the capacity to be free, as in the
loAver spheres what fails is the clear,
welldefined knowledge of the true and of the
right.


When the hour of temptation comes, there
is nothing to fall back upon. Evil is the
refuge, between which and suicide, nothing is.


And then Society appears with its
wellmeant, silly remedies, applicable to the effect,
and leaving the cause untouched. And when
it has to chronicle the perpetual reversion to
sin of its momentary converts, it moans over
the ingratitude of human nature, the
degeneracy of our age, and the strength of evil,
just as octogenarian absolutists twaddle over
the manifest victory of the devil in the ad\Tance
of political liberty. Try education as in
America—Avdiolesale; real bond fide education,
by which the superior utility of good is
mastered. Teach the truth of religion;
strengthen faith by knowledge; show the
piety of toil, and boldly proclaim the bare fact
that Providence does not desert those who do  
  
  
  L 2
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 148 -->
their utmost (less will not do); teach this in
all its forms, to high and to low, so that the
Avomen of the more fortunate classes may knoAV
how to help their poorer sisters. Do this Avith
heart and soul, and with intelligence and
method, and your midnight tea-parties and
your whole mistaken system of antidotes to sin
will be superseded. School-houses and
associations for the employment of Avomen will
alone prevent the sin; and prevention, in this
case, is all you have to look to, for cure is next
to impossible. Deal with the root of the evil
—cut it; but don't think anything can be done
Avith the evil itself if you alloAv it to be, and to
groAv. Above all, don't disguise it, or seek to
beautify it. Don't represent it otherwise than
it is. It is very ugly.


As soon as Madeleine had attained to the
physical equilibrium which is termed health,
and Avhich Avas afforded her by food, Avine,
sleep, air, exercise, and quiet, she began to
take delight in the beautiful clothes which were
brought her, and in the beautiful house in
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 149 -->
which she lived; and though, in her innermost
conscience, she did not think she ever achieved
as much show as she would have liked, yet so
thorough was her gratitude to M. de Moranges,
Avho took possession of her, so absolute her
submission to his smallest wish, that she tried
not to long for the gaudy apparel and
villanously unartistic accoutrements in which she
met those of her own species in public places.


As is so often the case (if not even always)
this girl was chiefly riveted to her sin by what
was best in her. And do not forget that, my
friend, when you are trying to upset some evil:
look out for the good element that has got
mislaid amongst it, and is feeding the eAul with
its strong sap; it will give you more trouble
than all the rest; the more so, as it hurts your
conventional ideas to recognise it.


In Madeleine's ill-regulated mind, gratitude
to M. de Moranges predominated over all else.
She thanked him for life, and for the enjoyment
of living; for food, clothing, and a home; for
the sense that she was admired, and treated by
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 150 -->
those who approached her with respect. From
the time she awoke till the hour when she
closed her eyes, there was no moment in which
she did not feel that she was grateful to M. de
Moranges : materially grateful for hard matters
of fact—for, to her mind, her position was
splendid: the position of the conclusion of
fairy tales, a vague impression Avhereof lies,
more or less, at the bottom of the mind of
every child of no matter Avhat degree.


Madeleine devoted herself as to a duty to
the task of thanking M. de Moranges, and to
this task brought all the resources she could
dispose of. The chief of all was obedience.
She was submissive as a spaniel.


The Marquis had, in the beginning, asked
her if she had no other name than Madeleine,
and she had replied Yes; she Avas also called
Claudine after her father.


\"Then we will call you Claudine in future,"
had said M. de Moranges; " it is better than
Madeleine."  
  
  
  "Why?" asked the girl.
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 151 -->

\"Well, because I like it better," replied the
Marquis, Avith a smile.


That was sufficient She was for ever more
Claudine, and Madeleine ceased to be.


I repeat it: she gave herself up to the task
of thanking M. de Moranges; that is, she gave
of herself all that she knew.  
  
  
  The woman was dormant in Claudine.
<!-- Leaf 164 -->
  
  CHAPTER XL  
  
  
  IMITATION RESPECTABILITY.


It Avas an odd mixture of feeling which
prompted M. de Moranges to Avhat he did in
regard to Claudine. M. de Moranges was a
man of refined taste, and a cultivated lover of
the arts, and when, in the vestibule at
Sauveterre he caught sight of the wet, dirty, shivering
girl who asked for help from starvation, his
attention was arrested and held captive by the
strange beauty of certain lines. His first
thought Avas of a statue he had long dreamed
of, and could get executed nowhere. He had
met in Rome Avith a sculptor Avho seized the
idea but failed in the execution, and who
admitted that the total want of a model was
his difficulty. The idea was Goethe'sEiqihorion,
the child of Faust and Helen, the offspring of
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 153 -->
Antique Beauty and Modern Thought, the
sexless, ageless, product of the contact of two
worlds. Here was the model found; here was
the possible realization of the artistic dream.


Henri Dupont, who was a younger and a far
less experienced man than the Marquis, had
simply reverted to a known type, and been
reminded of the Medusa. M. de Moranges
sought the form for an Idea, and found it, as
he fancied, in the sharp, pure outlines and
intensely painful expression of a face suddenly
brought under his notice.


The first impression was purely artistic. The
second was of a Arery complicated nature.


When the Widow Raynal's daughter had
been proATided by the housekeeper at
Suaveterre with dry and decent clothing, and when
she had supped and slept, and came the next
morning to speak to her benefactors, the effect
produced on the master of the house and on
his visitor was a very different one.


The former was struck only by her wan and
exhausted appearance; her pallor and her
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 154 -->
emaciation fairly frightened him: the latter
saAV far beyond all these, and Avas irresistibly
attracted.


The girl Avas young enough, in spite of what
she had suffered, to look better even by
daylight than lamplight, and what would inevitably
be her future beauty asserted itself in spite of
her squalor.


The Marquis scrutinised her as though she
had been a picture.


"Just wrap that round you," said he, taking
a cover of crimson silk from a table, and
tendering it to her, and when she had clone so,
throAving the folds back from her head,—


\"Yes ! " he added, musingly, and as if
speaking to himself, " her natural background is red
—a deep Titian red; the pale fair lights of the
skin and hair detach themselves so finely,
Avhilst the dark brown-gold of the eyes
harmonises so Avell."


And then he talked to her for some time,
and told her she must be called Claudine.  
  
  
  M. de Moranges was fifty-five, nor did he
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 155 -->
look younger. He had been one of the
handsomest men of his time, and would probably
continue to bear Avitness to that fact to his last
hour, for his was the superiority of feature and
of air. He possessed the art—without which
even the greatest man Avould scarcely be great
—that of imposing his individuality upon his
fellow men. Whatever he did that was wrong
(and he did much) was excused because he did
it, and nothing that he did passed unnoticed.
Society had adopted him for one of its spoilt
children, and he treated Society Avith a high
hand. Unmarried and enormously rich (though
he had considerably damaged his fortune), he
still remained an aim towards which tended
the spirit of gain and enterprise, and to attain
which all mothers of families were ready to
send forth Argonautic expeditions. But the
real superiority of M. de Moranges lay in the
belief the world had that he could do without
it, whereas he did not believe the Avorld could
do without him.  
  
  
  The Marquis had tried many things, but
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 156 -->
there was one thing he had not tried, and
towards Avhich—like many men of his age and
temperament — he had a strong and secret
leaning: namely, toAvards the fashioning of a
human creature for his own exclusive benefit.


And so, hardly avoAving the fact to himself,
he took Claudine, and resolved so to set his
impress upon her, that she should to him be
exactly Avhat he chose, and to the whole rest of
the world be nothing.


Here again you have the inconsistency and
dishonesty which is so curiously at work in
the present clay in France.


What M. de Moranges wanted was a home,
a centre round Avhich he could group AAdiatever
external elements best pleased him, but the
price to pay for this is marriage, and that
price to the Marquis seemed intolerably too
high. He, Avho Avould not have borne a copied
picture on one of the AA'alls of his dwelling,
agreed to regard as genuine this copy of an
institution, and he decided upon attempting to
defraud Truth of its rights by obtaining from
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 157 -->
a make-believe that which the real thing alone
has in its gift.


For a year Claudine was trained and put
into the hands of the first dressmakers in
Paris. She was taught to dance, and to walk,
and to hold herself, and to eat properly, and a
writing master tried to make her write neatly,
and a professor of literature made her read,
and endeavoured to awaken in her the
comprehension of Avhat she read. As she had a
beautiful mezzo-soprano voice, a singing master
was applied to, and every day two hours were
spent by Claudine, one in learning to sing, the
other in learning to play.


Well, it was rather a slowr process; for as I
said, the girl was by nature dull, but she was
perfectly obedient, and in all things did her
very best.


At the end of the year, Claudine made her
first appearance in the world of fashion, and
produced so decided a sensation that M. de
Moranges was deeply gratified, and felt
assured he had not made a mistake. The
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 158 -->
centre he had desired was found. To his
hotel in the Rue de "Grenelle every man of any
name or distinction in France came readily;
his dinners were what some feAv very old men
among his guests said Talleyrand's had used
to be, and Madame Claudine was accepted as
the presiding deity of the Marquis's table and
household, with all the outward semblances of
unflinching respect.


Claudine's home and mode of life were
austere, exceedingly. Of women, none were ever
invited to the Hotel de Moranges, nor did she
know other than by name the frail goddesses
of that impure Olympus, at the summit of
which she Avas herself placed in public opinion.


Claudine was so content, materially speaking,
so full of wonder still at the grandeur of her
position, that she had had no opportunity of
knoAving Avhether time hung heavily on her
hands; she had, as yet, no consciousness of
ennui. One unsatisfied desire Claudine had,
which has been already mentioned; she would
have liked more show. If she had dared
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 159 -->
question the supreme wisdom of her benefactor
(such he was to her, pray do not forget that),
she would have felt herself somewhat aggrieved
by the severe simplicity to which she was
mostly condemned. She did not avow it to
herself: but she did in reality pine for finery.
All her points of comparison, taken from
without, marked down finery as a species of right,
and something within her—something that was
never still, suggested that no amount of
gorgeous clothing Avas sufficient to cover the
poverty of the past.


However, the Marquis was inexorable—
gently so, but inexorable on this subject; so
Claudine was sentenced to be the best-dressed
woman in Paris, without any power to
appreciate it; neither would he consent to her
being called Madame de Sainte Amaranthe, for
Avhich appellation she had a truly vivacious
longing. These were the only points on which
{empty}M. de Moranges and Claudine ever differed;
but her attempts to obtain what she wished
were, after all, but feeble ones, and so matters
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 160 -->
  
  remained as they were. But Claudine had a

companion.


There was in M. de Moranges that undying
sense of the respectable which never leaves a
Frenchman, and Avith which the perpetual
business of his life is to reconcile the most
irreconcilable things. What seems fitting, what
seems proper—that is the domestic religion of
the whole race, and from that faith nothing
has ever weaned them—not even the scaffold
of the Reign of Terror, nor the Saturnalia of
the goddess Reason. A Frenchman's mind
—his entire nature—are con-centric, not
ec-centric; he revolts from all eccentricity as
unfitting, unseemly, and whatever his acts may be,
he contrives so to shape them that they shall
be shut in Avithin the bars of the Procrustes
bed of les convenances.


Now no amount of preaching would have
made M. de Moranges abstain from the
indulgence of any one of his vices; but the most
unlimited indulgence of these vices never
carried him away, never made him concede
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 161 -->
one iota in matters of taste, and while
outraging Virtue at every hour, and in the very
depths of his conscience, his outward life was
devoted to the scrupulous worship of the idol,
Seemliness.  
  
  
  Madame Claudine was, as it has been stated,

the presiding deity of the household; and
what a household ! From attic to cellar, every
detail defied scrutiny, every service was
complete. Severity was the ruling characteristic.
Equipages, liveries, furniture, plate—all was
severe; but of such a splendid severity ! And
in that whole household, all was so nicely
calculated that the slightest derangement would
have caused incalculable confusion. But
nothing was ever known to have been deranged;
derangement of any kind would have been
contrary to the traditions of the house. When
Madame Claudine was appointed to the
Favouriteship, it occurred in a quiet, seemly way, and
was altogether a transaction full of dignity, and
if she had the requisite aptitudes, there was no
reason why Madame Claudine might not become  
  
  
  A'OL. I.  
  
  
  II
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 162 -->
a perfect model of good breeding and
graceful manners : a person to be copied by all those
who aspire to the regency of drawing-rooms.


As was said, Claudine had a companion, and
it Avas the Marquis's first difficulty. He thought
it fitting that the person who presided over
his household should be accompanied wherever
she went, and he accordingly looked out for
the proper species of matron to attend upon
her. He wished her to be matronly, as that
Avas more respectable, but in this emergency,
respectability signally failed in the high duties
of its calling. As soon as it was rumoured
what M. de Moranges sought for, the number
of respectable ladies Avith interesting stories,
and unimpeachable references, that succeeded
each other was enormous, and the Marquis
was shocked at the amount of dignity in
distress whose representatives assailed him. He
chose more than once, but each time unluckily,
and respectability in these several elderly
females laid itself open to the most grievous
charges of corruption, and on one occasion
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 163 -->
made away with no inconsiderable amount of
linen and plate.


{empty}M. de Moranges modified his tactics and
conceded a point or two. Instead of seeking
for the respectability which turned out to
be a mere mask for speculation and intrigue,
he decided upon trying what could be done in
the way of relative honesty based upon
selfinterest. The plan succeeded better. A Paris
tradesman's daughter, tolerably well educated,
and whose experience of life was hard, a
goodlooking young Avoman just turned thirty, in
whose composition sentiment had no part,
undertook the charge of being companion to
Madame Claudine. Certain unfortunate
passages in this young lady's past, in which mere
miscalculation had achieved the work of
socalled devotion, had transformed her into a
sworn enemy to all romance, and she earned
her wages honestly enough, being in reality a
safe companion and associate for Claudine.
She dressed well, spoke, and even wrote her
OAvn language not too incorrectly, and wasexM 2
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 164 -->
cellently regular in her habits. Her faults
Avere that she Avas over fond of the minor
theatres, and would persist in talking of her
family, but on the whole she did well, and
had been six months attached to the household
of M. le Marquis, whose superiority she fully
appreciated Avithout being overwhelmed by it.


This gentleAvoman's real name was
Mademoiselle Aspasie Mourjon, but she insisted on
being denominated Mademoiselle de
Mourjonville, and on this point she was stubborn.
As she suited M. de Moranges in other respects,
he gave in, and Madame Claudine's
lady-inwaiting was officially styled de Mourjonville,
which high-sounding title, however, merged,
little by little, into that of Mademoiselle
Aspasie, by which name she now usually went.


Whence had come the surname given to
Claudine herself, none can tell. But so soon
as at the Italiens and at the Opera, at the Bois
and at the Courses, her face had grown to be
familiar to the public, the appellation of the
Sphinx had been awarded to her.
<!-- Leaf 177 -->
  
  CHAPTER XII.  
  
  
  MY NEPHEW.


The day after her visit to the Opera,
Claudine was sitting in a small boudoir
opening upon the garden. The Aveather was
unusually fine for April, and although a bright
Avood fire was burning on the hearth, the
window was open, and the warm air came in laden
Avith the scent of earth, and grass, and leaves,
and alive with the songs of birds.


Claudine was alone; upon a table beside
her were books and several sheets of paper,
and she had in her hand a mother-of-pearl
pen mounted in gold, which she was turning
round between her fingers lazily. Her look
was at once vacant and intent, and the only
way to describe her would be to say that she
was doing nothing determinedly. It was
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 166 -->
precisely this union of fixity and vagueness which
made the expression of her face so strange.
From the straight line of the prominent
eyebrow, the dusky eyes took an air of depth that
was more in their setting and their colour than
in any particular meaning of their own.


As she sat there, with parted lips, and gaze
intently bent upon the blue sky that was
visible beyond the high Avail of the garden, she
seemed to merit thoroughly the name that
had been bestowed upon her. It was not the
massive, heavy-lipped, heavy-eyed,
heavy-featured, Sphinx of the sluggish Nile, but it
was equally mysterious. The enigma was the
same, but the modern enigma, dreamy and
restless. It Avas something you could not
make out, and which, for that very reason,.
attracted you.


Claudine was draped in the thick folds of a
violet damask dress; she had no headdress
save her OAvn fair hair, Avhich undulated
naturally, and which every noAv and then the vagrant
wind lifted from the pale blue-veined broAv.
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 167 -->
  
  Two o'clock struck.


Mademoiselle Aspasie came in looking
unamiable.  
  
  
  " Herminie is going," she said, rather sharply.


Claudine turned her glance from the
contemplation of vacancy to that of Mademoiselle
Aspasie's countenance—but said nothing.


\"Herminie will go—she persists in going,"
reiterated the companion, as though she felt
injured by the want of interest taken in her
communication.


"I suppose we can find another maid to
take her place," suggested Claudine.


\"It is probable," retorted Mile. Aspasie,
\"that when I have put all my energy into the
undertaking, we may end by replacing
Herminie; but it is the third time—and so it will
go on to the end of the chapter—and M. le
Marquis, and you, too, Madame, seem always
to think everything is so easy! whereas, if it
were not for my ceaseless labour and attention
we should never have a femme de chambre at
all—I'm sure I work myself to death! "
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 168 -->

Mile. Aspasie's specialty was to persuade
everybody of her indispensability, and of the
large amount of her devotion to her employers.


"Why does Herminie go?" inquired
Claudine lazily.


\"Oh ! for the same reason that they all go! "
retorted the lady in waiting, shrugging her
shoulders. " She says she Avants to serve in a
respectable family, and that if she stays here
too long, nobody will take her."


Claudine opened her eyes, and looked as if
she was puzzled, and did not altogether
understand !


Mademoiselle Aspasie, Avho Avas not of her
nature, taciturn, AATent on.


"Yes!" repeated she; "they all say the
same thing; but it is only a pretext: the real
fact is, they bore themselves to death; the
house is dull! it is no use denying it; there's
no movement, no amusement, no fun, nothing
fast. What are they to do ? What is to
become of them ? the house is dull! "  
  
  
  "Is it? " demanded Claudine, Avith a curious
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 169 -->
expression of face. "Well, what is to be
done?"


\"Nothing, Madame ! " retorted
authoritatively Aspasie; " there is nothing to be done
but to go on changing! I had thought of
proposing to M. le Marquis to get over an
Englishwoman: they say they are steady, and
can do without amusement; here it is next to
impossible—in spite of the enormous wages
they get, and the comforts and luxuries, they
none of them will stay! they seem to think it
unjust; and they will actually rather sink
down_to being the maid of some stupid
humdrum bourgeois1 wife (with a chance of
marrying the man-serArant!) than be moped up, as
they call it, with us. I dare say we shall be
obliged to get over an Englishwoman in the
end! Money, they say, will make them do
anything, whereas, one can do nothing with a
Parisian, if she gets no amusement."


During this tirade, Claudine had relapsed
into her former distraught and vacant air, and
Mademoiselle Aspasie now turned some portion
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 170 -->
of her attention upon her, casting a glance at
the books and papers on the little table.


"Ah! ah!" observed she, with this time a
good-humoured smile, but still with the same
air of importance; " I see Iioav it is! no
lessons done; and M. Blanchon comes at
halfpast three."


"It is very difficult," objected Claudine,
meekly. " I cannot manage it."


Mademoiselle Aspasie stretched out her
hand, took up tAvo books, and, seating herself,
prepared in a business-like Avay to examine the
task set down for the dull-brained pupil.


\"Well," said she, holding out the smaller of
the two volumes, " here is one you can do,
Madame; it is merely to copy out this page of
verses from—from "— and she turned over
page after page. " Oh ! I see ! from the play
of Britannicus, Tragedy by Jean Racine; that
you can do; the verses begin here at the
top of the page," and she laid the book open
at the proper place, and prepared the paper,
and pen, and ink. " You need only mark each
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 171 -->
Avord well, and then copy it out exactly. The
other lesson is more difficult—it is an analysis
of a whole chapter of the History of Louis XIV.
—twelve pages! and battles, and all sorts of
things! However, I will see what I can do.
We must try and manage it all between us, or
{empty}M. Blanchon will be angry, and complain to
{empty}M. le Marquis! "


And Mademoiselle Aspasie put both her
elboAvs on a table in the middle of the room,
laid the book down before her, and set to work
tooth and nail, with the fierce energy of a
clever Frenchwoman, who foresees a clear and
certain gain at the end of the effort she is
making.


The rays of the sun came in, and played with
the light, crisply curled hair, that adorned
Claudine's bending head, and into which her
long, thin, ivory fingers, with pale nails, had,
in sign of distress, twisted themselves. And
the soft wind still brought in the scents of
spring, and the songs of birds from the
garden.
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 172 -->

"Aspasie," said Claudine, after a period of
application to her studies, which seemed to
call for some relaxation; "it will be Easter
week in a few days; one can't Avear velvet after
Easter."


"No, Madame! one cannot," replied
Mademoiselle Aspasie, looking up from her Avork;
\"but one can wear other things—light silks,
and muslins."


"Velvet is rich," remarked Claudine, with
Avhat for her Avas an emphasis; and Avhilst the
hand that held the pen glided listlessly down
by her side, the other hand, half hidden in the
flaxen braids, supported the head more firmly,
and she looked fixedly at her companion,
repeating her words.  
  
  
  " Velvet is rich—crimson velvet above all."


\"Crimson velvet makes you look like a
queen, Madame," observed Mile. Aspasie,
crossing both her hands upon the open book
before her, and gazing straight into the very
depths of Claudine's mysterious eyes.  
  
  
  " Like a queen! " murmured the latter,
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 173 -->
musingly. "Like a queen, Aspasie?" and
this time she put the question wonderingly.


Mademoiselle Aspasie had picked up a
pencil and was biting one end of it with her
sharp-pointed teeth, whilst her sharp eyes (in
which a minute observer might have detected
a latent tAvinkle of self-satisfaction) never ceased
watching Claudine.


"Well, like a queen! " she repeated; "and
why not? Why shouldn't you look like a
queen, Madame ? There have been queens who
Avere not ladies: and the proverb says kings
have married beggar maids."


\"Kings ! " echoed Claudine. " Yes, I know,
the proverb does say so; " and she fell to
musing again, and looked dreamily at the blue
sky above the garden wall, while the soft wind
was again busy with the feathery tresses ot
her fair hair. " And I suppose the kings who
married beggar-maids had seen them in their
rags," she added.


\"What on earth do the old rags matter? "
exclaimed the practical companion, with a
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 174 -->
sneer. " When they are once cast off, they're
forgotten."  
  
  
  "You think so?" questioned Claudine.


Mademoiselle Aspasie laughed a laugh of
contempt.


"Think so?" she retorted. "Yes, I fancy
I do. No one has got any past now, thank
God! A good past don't benefit, and a bad
past don't hurt you;—and right lucky it is
that it is so. People just live on Avhat they are
at the present moment, and it is their business
to see that they make their present moment
a prosperous one, and have plenty of
everything, and are wise enough to lay by, so that
the present may endure, and the past never
come back again."


Mademoiselle Aspasie inculcated this lesson
with apparently strong conviction, and,
developing the theme complacently, added that
personalties of intrinsic worth were what were
to be mostly aimed at.


"M. le Marquis," opined she, approvingly,
\"is an example in that respect—all his tastes
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 175 -->
are so solid. I know the objection made is to
their austerity—and, in some degree, I would
myself object to that too; but his age and
education account for a good deal. The men
of his day were more serious, and held to
repose and quietness as to a proof of good taste;
but, however that may be, there is no doubt of
the solid genuineness of everything. What
plate, and linen, and furniture; what valuables !
Ah, you are a fortunate person, Madame. I
don't say you don't deserve your luck—but it
is luck all the same—luck that makes you the
object of universal envy."


Claudine listened silently, but with evident
satisfaction, to this praise of her good fortune.
After a pause, during which her memory,
perhaps, recalled to her the comments she had
heard, the night before, upon her own
appearance :


\"How my jewels are devoured by the eyes
of all those fine ladies," she remarked: "I
can't help seeing the sensation they create
whenever I wear them. There was one woman
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 176 -->
in particular, last night, at the foot of the great
staircase—a fine, handsome blonde, with hair
covered with pearls "


\"And a satin dress, and feathers, and silver
lace?" interrupted Aspasie. "Lots of hair,
and lots of pearls—both false, I'll bet
anything ? One meets her always everywhere!
It is that famous Duchesse de Varignan."


"How I wish I might be dressed like her! "
sighed Claudine. " She is always so finely
dressed!" and she added lazily, "I wonder
what she would give to have my jewels! "


\"Everything ! " cried Mile. Aspasie. " You
should rather ask what is there she would not
do?"


In which appreciation of our fair friend, the
Duchesse, Mile, de Mourjonville Avas
singularly mistaken.
The noise of a door opening in the next room
was heard.


Claudine raised herself from what had been
a half-recumbent posture, and looked at the
mirror over the chimney-piece, in Avhich you
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 177 -->
could see reflected whoever entered the
drawing room behind, and between which and the
boudoir there was one entire panel of
plateglass.


The Marquis de Moranges stepped through
the open door; he Avas followed by another
man, young and exceedingly handsome.


A flood of scarlet rushed over Claudine's
pale face; and, in a tone of the deepest
mortification,—


\"Oh, if I only had on my crimson Arelvet! "
whispered she.


The companion rose, and stood in an
attitude of respect, as her employer entered.


{empty}M. de Moranges advanced Avith measured
step and dignified air; and, with courtly grace,
pointing to his friend, said, whilst boAving down
to kiss Claudine's hand,—


\"Permit me, madame, to present to you
{empty}M. le Marquis de Beauvoisin, my nephew."

  CHAPTER XIII.  
  
  
  MUSICAL LINKS.


The Marquise de Beauvoisin, dowager, had
been as good as her word, and at the end of a
week or ten days after her conversation with
Madame de Clavreuil, she had established so
satisfactory an overseership upon her brother's
actions, that nothing- of what M. de Moranges
did could escape her. How she continued this,
we shall, perhaps, discover later. The
Doavager de Beauvoisin was not a woman tormented
with vain scruples where a great end was at
stake; but it is certain that, without her
brother's suspicion of the fact, she managed to
draw him into the atmosphere in which she
herself lived and moved. She was far too wise
a woman to appear desirous of seeing more of
him than he voluntarily alloAved her to see, and
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 179 -->
she never made a single remark upon his
comparative disappearance from society, or upon
any of his habits or ways whatever. She,
seemingly, took him as he was, and on all
occasions met him with the blandest
goodhumour, not to say cordiality or affection. The
widowed Marquise and her brother were too
Avell bred ever to be cordial to any one, and
they knew each other too thoroughly to be ever
affectionate. But what the lady did achieve
AAras, that they should meet on neutral ground
nearly every day. She caught M. de Moranges
in the toils of relationship, bound him down by
his family ties, being quite aware of his deep
sense of social decencies, and of the sacrifices
he would be induced to make to the fitness of
things.


She herself never once invited him to her
house, but on the occasion of Olivier's marriage
and return home, she raked up every cousin, in
no matter what degree, whom she could find,
and impressed upon each several one the duty
of giving a banquet in honour of thenew>- 2
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 180 -->
married couple, and of bidding to it all those
Avho had the honour of being connected with
the Beauvoisin race.


{empty}M. de Moranges never once flinched (his wily
sister had rightly foreseen that he would not);
in the name of his House he bore everything
manfully, and ate six dinners a week (whereof
five were generally bad) with people Avho suited
him ill, and whom in his secret soul he Avished
at Cayenne, or anywhere, Avhence they would
not be likely to return. But he bore it, and
might, if he had cared for it, have had the
satisfaction of hearing hoAv he had charmed all
the younger women, many of whom had met
him for almost the first time, and all of whom
lamented that he did not more frequent the
world.


The Dowager Marquise, Avhenever she was
Avithin earshot of her brother, descanted upon
social obligations; proved herself large-minded
and liberal as to what regarded the conduct of
her fellow creatures; said that lay between
themselves and a Higher Power; and laid it
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 181 -->
doAvn as a law that a strong sense of what is
clue to the ties of family, a real respect for
consanguinity, was all that could be required of a
man of the world and a gentleman. It was
pleasant to hear her discourse, her brother
thought, for it helped to put him at his ease
with regard to his blood-relations, and
persuaded him he was behaving uncommonly
well at an undoubtedly cheap price.


The only little bit of wickedness Madame de
Beauvoisin allowed herself was, one day, after
she had been declaiming over the admirable
manner in which every relative, however
distant, of their House had come forward, to
turn to M. de Moranges, and observe, in a
perfectly casual Avay, that out of the sixty-four or
five persons then in Paris, who had asserted
their connection with Olivier by fe.asting him
and his wife, he, Olivier's own uncle, was the
only one who had not given him a wedding
dinner!


It seemed to escape the Dowager's lips—
dropped involuntarily from them—but was said
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 182 -->
without the slightest accent of reproach or
unkindness. It was a fine bit of acting, and
hit M. de Moranges so hard from the point of
view of social obligations, that, to rehabilitate
himself in his own conscience, he would have
consented to eat two dinners a day, if needful.


Of his new niece M. de Moranges approved
highly, making this one reserve, that you never
could know what a woman was till she was past
thirty; but he only expressed this opinion of
his to his most intimate associates, men of his
own age and standing. Claire pleased him very
much, gratified his taste, flattered his self-love,
and had for him something of the same charm
that was exercised over him by her aunt,
Clementine. As for Olivier, he had long ago made
up his mind that there was nothing at all in
him, and the only curiosity he felt was to know
how, with the education he had been subjected
to, he would behave in certain crises of life, and
whether sufficient honesty and principle had
been instilled into him to enable him to pass
through all ordeals like a gentleman.
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 183 -->

And yet, Avith these doubts, and Avith the fact
staring him in the face, of his nephew's
education affording no guarantee for uprightness
through life, M. de Moranges, had he had a
son, would have brought him up exactly as his
sister had brought up 01i\Tier. And why?
simply because that Avas the sort of education
usually given to the sons of great families—to
the young men of the class who consider it a
distinction to do nothing.


{empty}M. de Moranges had been charmed with
the dinners given him by his nephew and
niece; charmed, because the cook at the Hotel
de Beauvoisin was a first-rate artist, that every
detail of the service of the house was precisely
as it should be, and that Claire did the honours
of the abode with a grace and dignity which
reminded you of the days (within his own
remembrance) when the great ladies of France
had been the great ladies of the entire world.
Then, too, the Marquis was certain, whenever
he dined at the Hotel de Beauvoisin, to meet
Madame Beaudouin; and we have been told
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 184 -->
Iioav strong was the attraction this lady
exercised over him, Iioav he enjoyed her company
and her conversation.


So, in spite of all that the world said
touching the Sphinx, in spite of the public scandal
which clung to the Marquis's name and mode
of life, he lived more Avith his own family than
he had clone for the last year or fifteen months.
Thus far the Dowager de Beauvoisin had
succeeded : she had managed to have her brother
lured from his unsociable habits, and draAvn
back into the spheres Avhere she could bring her
keen spirit of observation to bear upon him;
but this was but one portion of AA^hat she needed.
When M. de Moranges left the places in which
his sharp-eyed sister could study him, he
escaped from all immediate action on her part,
and she could not follow him into his OAvn
home. Her Avatchfulness then became
necessarily indirect, or second-hand.


The Dowager took to a line of strategy Avith
her son which, had his perceptions not been
opaque, must have astonished him. She became
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 185 -->
full of tolerance for human errors, and said men
Avere fallible and must not be too harshly
judged, particularly by those who were younger
than themselves. All this was imparted to
Olivier alone—never in the presence of his Avife,
for she opined that the truth was not always to
be proclaimed before very young women, for it
might, by being misapplied, become dangerous.


Madame de Beauvoisin adopted the custom
of frequently paying visits to her son in the
blue and silver draperied room in AA-hich we
haAre already seen him, and the gaudiness
AA'hereof was entirely her work. She would
just look in after breakfast, let Olivier go on
smoking (though she abominated that habit),
and retail out to him all the delicate tit-bits
of scandal that might happen to be
unpublished. His mother's visits always amused
Olivier, and her talk set him at his ease, and
delivered him from the trouble of thinking for
himself.


She invariably mentioned her brother in
terms of the sincerest regard, and contrived
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 186 -->
to allude either to the last time he had come to
her son's house, or to the next time he would
come there.


\"He comes so often to you iioav," she said
one day, on rising to take leave of Olivier,
\"that I sometimes think he must be a little
hurt at the Avant of reciprocity—" and she
hesitated.


\"Reciprocity ! " echoed M. de Beauvoisin,
looking puzzled; " Avell! it's very
difficult—I don't quite see Iioav—" and he, in his turn,
paused.


\"Certainly," resumed the Dowager; " it is,
as you say, with the good sense that
characterises you—it is difficult; but I sometimes
am inclined to fancy that your duty Avould be to
stretch a point. After all, he is your uncle—
your very nearest relation upon earth. I have
always held ■ that an uncle Avas nearer than a
brother; he comes, in my mind, directly after
one's OAvn father; and then one must be
indulgent, too ! Such a deplorable connection as
that of my poor brother's Avith that woman,
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 187 -->
once admitted, it is really impossible to arrange
matters more respectably than he does, or with
a deeper sense of what is due to his own
position and to society. You see, his influence in
his department is still enormous; and when
the elections take place, two or three years
hence, he may be everything to you for the
deputation, and one is bound to think of one's
children before everything. You must think of
little Pierre—-it is your first duty. I assure
you I have come to the opinion that it is wrong
to neglect your uncle."


Olivier was sitting with his legs wide apart,
and his body bent forward, an elbow on each
thigh, and his hands hanging down, than which
scarcely any attitude expresses a more thorough
emptiness of mind and absence of will. He
stared at his mother, and propounded the
desire never in any way whatever to neglect
his uncle if he could only find the means to
prove that fact to M. de Moranges.


\"Ought I to go and dine with him ? " he
asked.
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 188 -->

"If he asks you —yes: I think decidedly
you ought," had been his mother's reply.  
  
  
  " But Claire ? " added Olivier, dubiously.


\"I think I should not tell Claire anything
about it. There are often things that a man
may find it advisable to do, about which it
would be unfitting that he should speak to his
wife. The more I think of it, the more
convinced I am that you are doing wrong to
neglect your uncle."


And on this idea the wise matron left her
son, well knowing that, as his brain never took
in more than one idea at a time, it would stick
to this one tenaciously, and probably evolve it
into a practical result. And so it happened;
and when Olivier seized the first opportunity
offered to him by his uncle, and alloAved
himself to be presented to the Sphinx by M. de
Moranges, he was, in fact, only following out
the advice given him by the doAvager.


After that first visit, M. de Beauvoisin
returned frequently to the Hotel de Moranges,
dined there, or breakfasted, and grew to be
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 189 -->
a denizen of Madame Claudine's
draAvingroom.


Olivier, as we know, Avas not Avhat is called
bright, nor was perspicacity among his
characteristics. He never remarked the curious
glances which sometimes were levelled at him
by Mile. Aspasie, and which apparently
denoted an intimate acquaintance with him,
productive of an odd mixture of compassion and
contempt. Neither had he ever observed the
embarrassment of Madame Claudine in his
presence—an embarrassment that endured long
after Olivier had become a familiar visitor at
the house, and which, while it certainly
imparted a kind of awkwardness to her demeanour,
lent her, at the same time, an unmistakeable
charm, inasmuch as it roused her out of her
usual slow, sleepy, uninteresting manner.


From the very first day on which M. de
Beauvoisin had been presented to Claudine, a
link had been discovered between these two,
and that link was music.  
  
  
  Alas ! that it should be so; but so it is, and
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 190 -->
so it Avill remain, till the system is changed
Avhereby in this our day human souls are so
foolishly or culpably tampered -with by their
so-called Instructors.


Fear being the leading motive of nine-tenths
of all the actions committed in our time (at all
events, in Continental Europe), you may set
doAvn Avhatever is allowed in education, to the
desire of avoiding something Avorse.
Throughout all Continental countries you will find fear
actuating all educators—Avhether mothers, or
priests, or the courtiers whose task it is to
bring up princes. What they most fear is
science, namely light. Therefore, having some
vague notion that the faculties ought to be
employed, they complacently guide them
toAvards the fields of art, and let them feed there,
deeming that innocuous.


What escapes them is the mysterious
solidarity of our being, and that oneness-in-variety
of our nature that may produce an explosion of
genius in the brain from the mere material
touch upon some conductor among the nerves.
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 191 -->
Of that electricity which is around us and
within us, they know nothing, and Avhen they
have succeeded in comparatively swathing a
mind in obscurity, they are stupidly content,
and don't reflect that the soul's lightning flashes
fiercest when all else is dark.


They shut out science, and fancy that the
door opened upon art will let in no danger;
calculating thus, in ignorance of the finely
vibrating nerves which are reigning in the
stead of the narcotised reasoning faculties.
They will not see that passion is another form
of genius, and that in nearly every human
being lies dormant some one dominant
capacity. If a man be born to write the
Symphony in C minor, you gain but little by
bringing him up as a fool, or turning him into a
dragoon, or an attorney's clerk; if the
symphony be in him he will compose it, though
with other elements, and it will come forth
and terrify you in the shape of some formidable
love, or of some crime.  
  
  
  And so on from top to bottom of the ladder.
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 192 -->
You gain nothing by darkening or shutting in
the human mind; and the electricity is
everyAvhere, which may dart along the hidden wires,
and note doAvn in the soul's telegraphy a tale
which will frighten the timid cackling crowd of
lookers-on from their propriety.


There lies something in every creature of
our race. The business of the educators is to
make that something aspire, and, in the end,
attain to the clear comprehension of the
inseparable oneness of the True, the Beautiful, and
the Good. Where that is not done—beware !


There Avas something even in Olivier, even
in Claudine, and, wrapped as it might be in the
cere-clothes of ignorance and false-teaching,
that something lived on and was ready to
assert its power of living, just as the grain of
Avheat, lying for five thousand years at the
bottom of a mummy's tomb, asserts its force
of being, the instant you put it into a handful
of common earth.


Man has no more power to destroy than he
has to create. He can pervert, nothing more
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 193 -->
Nature has imprescriptible rights. And so,
in these two ill-educated, dark-minded human
beings, betrayed, as they were, by those whose
task it should have been to make them better,
there was yet something, and that something
quivered faintly into existence through the
medium of musical sound.


Of such compositions as you and I, being
educated people, dignify with the name of
music, these two knew nothing—how should
they ? but in a lower kind of art they took real
delight, and what was least material in them,
found satisfaction in the second and third rate
productions of a falsely sentimental Art.


Olivier played agreeably upon the pianoforte,
remembered whatever he heard once, proAuded
it was not what he called scientific, and
whatever in him had been carefully turned aAvay by
his teachers from all grander, healthier
currents, found an outlet in the performance of the
musical compositions he understood or
appreciated. Claudine took a deep and genuine
pleasure in listening to him, and he wasperVOL. I.  
  
  
  0
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 194 -->
fectly capable of enjoying the fine tones of her
passionless voice. Olivier taught Claudine
several abominably silly romances, but she
sang them as would sing an automaton. Still
the tAvo went on making music together, and
a day came when Claudine suddenly sang
Madame de Rothschild's romance of Si'vous
n'avez rien d me dire, with extraordinary
expression.
<!-- Leaf 207 -->
  
  CHAPTER XIV.  
  
  
  CLAIRE.


And while all these things were happening
around her, how was it with the young
Marquise de Beauvoisin ? How had it been with
Claire, since she deliberately obeyed her parents,
marrying deliberately the man she did not like ?


The world would have told you she fared
excellently well, and was what it is pleased to
call happy. Claire, in her secret soul, thought
hers a hard lot, and so perhaps it was, but
much less hard than it might have been had
she chosen. But Claire, like a great many
other people, though she did a duty, did not
do her duty.


There are far more of our fellow-creatures
than we believe, who discharge what they
impose upon themselves as duties; but there  
  
  
  o 2
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 196 -->
are fewer than we have any notion of who
unflinchingly and thoroughly, and at the same
time simply, discharge the duty which is theirs
to be done: theirs and none others; specially
set down for them, not to be accomplished by
any one else, and which to them costs the
dearest—costs indeed so dear that they recoil
and will not pay that price !


We have said that there was something
even in Olivier, in spite of all the defects Avith
Avhich his education had laden him. But that
something, did Claire discover it ? did she
recognise that it was really there ? Avould she
have been gratified at its existence, or did she
involuntarily cherish the notion of her
husband's inferiority? This was difficult to find
out, and the one man who was Olivier's sincere
friend, who had been so from childhood, Count
Dupont de Laporte, though he grew to be on
terms of great intimacy with the young
Marquise, somehow never cared to demonstrate to
her that there might be more in her husband
than she kneAV.
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 197 -->

\"I'm afraid she likes better to think loAA'ly
of him," he said one day to Madame Beaudouin,
Avho in true appreciation of his honest, upright
character, had spoken openly Avith him of the
young couple.


\"Lowly ! " Yes ! there it lay ! Claire liked
to think lowly of her husband. It was her
greatest consolation.


Claire was, in the common parlance of the
wrorld, and according to its ill-digested decrees,
a woman all but perfect. The pure beauty of
her mind was the Truth of which the pure
beauty of her person was the splendour.
Nothing was in her that was not lofty.
Intellectually and morally she had no tendency that
was not towards the elevated and the noble,
but she did not do her duty, for all that, and
perhaps because of all that, The plain duty of
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin's Avedded wife—which post
she had in the end accepted, and which post it
was forbidden her to desert—was to discover
what was best in the man Avhose name she
bore, and exercise her influence daily to
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 198 -->
improve the something she had discovered. But
this plain duty Claire overlooked, setting
herself altogether another task, and strictly
performing what appeared to her the duty.
Instead of labouring to develop the dormant
capacity of good in Olivier, and leading him
by no matter how slow a process, if it were
only one step higher up on the ladder, Claire
unconsciously went on mounting round after
round of the ladder herself, and could not
choose but be content with what she achieved.
She raised herself, yes! but she never
endeavoured to raise him; on the contrary, she left
him just where he Avas, and thought it right
to subordinate her mere acts to his Avill,
never disputing his authority, but never for
an instant desiring that he should be so
bettered as for her to esteem him. She obeyed
him implicitly, but never did she, the most
generous of her sex, practise generosity
toAvards him. She never drew nearer to him,
never drew him nearer to her; never held
out her hand to enable him to try if he could
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 199 -->
climb, but soared herself and lost sight of
him.


Claire de Beauvoisin laid out for herself a
dead duty, and was for ever busy in offering
up funeral sacrifices at its shrine. And this
Avas natural, for perhaps the living duty, the
plain simple duty of a less elevated Avoman
Avould have been too hard for her to perform.


Therein lies the chief sin of those who
undertake to dispose of the destinies of others
without taking the affections into account, They
place the poor weak creatures that we are
between the alternative of self-abasement or
duty discharged in abhorrence. Love alone
makes duty light; and, if you banish the love,
our imperfectness must find some shape in
which to assert itself.


Had Claire been perfect, she would have
done all her duties as Olivier's wedded wife;
she was imperfect, like all human beings, and
did not do it. She paid what she thought her
full tribute in material, smiling submission;
but hoarded up all her real treasures and spent
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 200 -->
them on herself. She lived outAvardly the life
of the world, reaping universal admiration and
respect. In her inner life, she lived aloof from
all men;—alone, communing only Avith herself:
and, in the existence her marriage had made
for her, Claire, the refined, the intellectual, the
cultivated, the high-souled Claire was as
solitary, as completely exiled from woman's
paradise, as was her dim-minded, ignorant, fallen
sister, Claudine.


Of all Avho surrounded her, not one ever
approached towards confidence Avith the young
Marquise. With Olivier, as we knoAV, she was
all obedience; Avith her mother-in-laAv her
bearing Avas a perpetually defensive one; with her
uncle Moranges she Avas thoroughly charming,
and almost natural. Henri Dupont she watched
naiTOAAdy, and seemed upon her guard Avith.
Towards her OAvn mother she never relaxed, but
behaved ahvays Avith freezing gentleness and
respect; with her aunt Clementine, Avhom she
noAv but rarely sought, she Avas mostly silent.
These tAvo seemed to understand each other,
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 201 -->
and not to need words. They Avould
sometimes pass a morning together, and not
exchange ten phrases; but the embrace in which
they folded each other at parting, said more
than mere words convey.


It must not be forgotten that Claire's feeling
towards Olivier was not simply indifference.
Whatever she knew of her heart had been
given to another; and the severe education of
young ladies in France, and the practice by
which they are secluded from the movements
of the external world, were likely to increase
rather than diminish the force of the firstimpression.


So Claire went on loving her cousin Victor—
loving him with all her imagination, and her
sense of disappointment. He Avas her illusion
in life—her chimera; the representative of all
that might and would have been happiness

if
{empty}M. de Lancour, it must be avowed, was the
ATery sort of person to provoke the admiration
and attachment of such a woman as Claire.
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 202 -->
He Avas the type of such soldiers as Trochu
would desire the French army to be composed
of: modest and daring, gentle and determined,
highly intellectual, yet physically reckless;
and, from the age of nineteen (lie had wilfully
enlisted at eighteen), having Avon glory by
exploits of extraordinary merits whether as to
valour or military capacity. He was, besides
this, remarkably good-looking, had winning
ways with Avomen, and had been brought up
Avith Claire in all the sweet familiarity of
cousinship.


A very unfortunate occurrence decided M.
•de Lancour's private career; though it in no
degree modified his habitual intercourse with
his oavu relations.


Madame de Mottefort, the wife of the
lieut.colonel of a cavalry regiment in which Victor
had just risen to the rank of captain, had
abandoned everything in the world to prove to
her lover of a day that hers was the love that
never dies, but braves all circumstance. The
sacrifice had been accepted. M. de Lancour
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 203 -->
was severely wounded in the duel he fought
with M. de Mottefort; he was blamed,
excused, condemned, absolved, but immoderately
talked about. He exchanged into a regiment
ordered off to Algeria, where his name figured
foremost in nearly every order of the day; and
whither Berthe de Mottefort followed him, and
partook of his fame. They were supposed to
lead a pleasant life; and the love these two
felt for each other had so vindicated its
strength, that it was admitted on all hands
that Victor was one of the few who had found
happiness in an illicit connection.


It was wrong, but successful so far. And
Claire, whose love was born in ignorance,
loved on when ignorance had ceased. Yes,
Claire loved on; and nothing in her mode of
life separated her from her love. She was
preserved from all harm and from all suspicion
by her marriage, and by the character she
edified for herself. Her apparent duties were
so scrupulously performed, she was so
unimpeachable in her conduct as wife, mother, and
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 204 -->
mistress of a house, that M. de Beauvoisin Avas
obliged to share the admiration of the Avhole
Avorld; and, sharing it genuinely, was often
perplexed in the extreme at the small amount
of domestic satisfaction, of home comfort,
derived from the possession of such a matchless
wife. In his OAvn pet phrase, He couldn't make
it out.


I am sorry to have to avow it, but her child
did not fill up the void in Claire's life; did not
compensate to her for the failure of other joys.
She was too young as yet for the grand austere
devotion to the creature that is to be the
parent's Avork; and too highly cultivated to
find solace in the doll-and-plaything-like
affection of some mothers too early wived. Claire
loved her son dearly, and Avas an excellent
mother in every sense; but her son did not
supply the place of everything else to her :
neither did religion. Claire Avas sincerely
pious; and, like most Frenchwomen of the
present day, of an enlightened piety, knoAving
what and wherefore she believed; and
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 205 -->
believing devoutly, uncompromisingly. But faith did
not occupy her totally. Faith underlay
everything in Claire, her actions and her thoughts;
but, above its firm foundation, there arose
many and many an aspiration, many a longing,
many a regret, many a dream.


Such as the young Marquise noAv was, it was
probable she would always remain. Her health
was excellent, she ate, drank, and slept well,
and took a real interest in whatsoever might
be interesting to a healthy, active mind. But
her mode of life and her mode of thought were
fashioned by something that lay Avithin her,
deeply hidden, which no one would ever divine,
and which she would never put away.


Passion-week was drawing to a close, and
Claire had, as is usual in France, spent a
large portion of her days at church, not from
habit, or for fashion's sake, but from
conviction, and a strong love of Him who saved us.
Not for that leaving any act of duty at home
undone, but seeking honestly at the altar's foot
the inspiration whereby to perform further duties.
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 206 -->

It was Good Friday, and the sermon upon
TJie Seven Words had come to an end. I
should like to be able to say that it had
impressed Claire, but that would be untrue; it
had not done so for two reasons: firstly,
because the preacher was a very inferior one,
noisy, exaggerated, and empty of the aAvful
glories of his text; and secondly, because
Claire happened to be in a someAvhat vacant
mood, and not ready to apply her mind to
abstract or contemplative uses.


When, towards the close of the day, the tones
of the Stabat Mater rang mournfully through
the dim aisles of the church, their solemn
meaning came more home than any preacher's words
to Claire's heart. She looked around at the
void and desolate tabernacles, at the lone
crucifix whence the Victim had been borne, at the
rent veils which hung drooping over the stains
of His blood, and she felt within her the deep
truth of the tragic mystery, bowed her head
down low, and wept with TJie Mother Avhom
nothing can console.
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 207 -->

But Claire wept not a mother's tears. That
grief she felt not, nor could assimilate it to
herself. She wept in sorrow over herself, and
tendered her suffering, her very own, at the
feet of Him who to redeem man had suffered
unto death. Claire was not impatient, but she
was sometimes weary, and, like many of us,
whether in sorrow or joy, she could not see
the future other than as the present. To wait,
to expect! she had not learnt that yet. For
what was she to wait ? Who should tell her ?


Ask not the spent wave for what it bore not!
Other waves will surge up on life's ocean, and
lay their treasures at your feet. But Claire
stood upon a lonely shore, as it seemed to her,
and the spent wave had broken at her feet, and
receded again, and brought her—nothing.


A chair was moved not far from her; its
occupant had let her prayer-book drop, stooped
to pick it up, in so doing disturbed her
neighbours, and when she knelt again, resting her
head upon her joined hands, the young
Marquise saw her face and knew her. That face
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 208 -->
Avas familiar to her, for without any living
being having been able to guess Avhy she
asked, she had taken care to have that face
pointed out to her. It was Berthe de
Mottefort.


Never, in any place of public resort, had
Madame de Mottefort been in such close vicinity
to Claire, and Claire's entire sum of attention
instantly riveted itself on her neighbour.
Perhaps she was scarcely aware of Iioav utterly
she forgot everything, in her intense desire to
scrutinise Berthe; perhaps it was unconsciously
that she deserted the mystery of her faith to
fasten upon the mystery of her love. But she
did so. She spelt every lineament of her rival's
countenance as an eager child labours to spell
through the words of a tale which he knows
contains a whole world of emotion for him.


It was a handsome face, but neither an
intellectual nor a remarkably good face. It Avas
marked, moreover, with signs of Avhat the past
had been. They were signs of anxiety rather
than of suffering, signs rather of pain than of
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 209 -->
sorrow; there was trouble, evident trouble;
but of regret, or of better things overthroAvn,
of high aspirations laid low, there seemed no
trace.


Claire did not first ask of her own judgment:
Does he love her? but with the divine belief
of woman in the all-compelling power of real
love, she scanned every feature of Madame de
Mottefort's face, and of every line and every
look asked, Does she love him ?


The something which lies at the bottom of
nearly every woman's heart, and which, if she
be a true and pure woman, and if she truly
love, will not mislead her, gave Claire a
negative answer. Then she read the face before
her with another feeling; with that of pity—
pity for him.


She, Claire de ClaAreuil, in the days of her
freedom, in the days of her innocent cousinship
with Victor, and of her sweet, sweet dream,
she had been worthy of him, and this woman,
whom he loved, was not. Whom he loved?
Yes! that was so—every proof was forthcoming  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  p
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 210 -->
of that truth, but he had blindly built his home
at the gates of Paradise, whilst Paradise itself
had been open to him. And this lesser love,
this sin-marked destiny, this was irrevocable,
yet could have been averted !


When the croAvd poured forth from the
church, Claire followed Madame de Mottefort
closely; watched her every movement, her
every step. She was graceful, yet there was a
certain abruptness in her movements, a certain
Avant of dignity and repose. At the bottom of
the steps leading up to the church they went
their several ways, and Claire, having watched
Madame de Mottefort get into her carriage,
entered hers and drove away.


It was a bright spring day, when everything
is full of hope and the promise of expanding
life, a closing April full of the announcements
of May. The sky was palely, tenderly blue,
the trees tenderly and palely green, and the
youth of the year was visible in the gladness
of nature in that exquisite freshness, in that
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 211 -->
sheen of colours and light Avhich does not
yet glow, and which vanishes beneath the
cumbrous tread of summer.


As Claire felt the light gladsome breeze
upon her cheek, she shrank and dreAV up the
window. As she marked the waving of the
trees, with their pale plumy foliage dancing in
the sun, she felt sadder than before, sick at
heart for the shadow that lay upon her, whilst
the bloom lay upon everything else. And,
then, Berthe's handsome face rose up before
her—the face which she felt had no promise in
it for him—and the young Marquise leaned
back in her carriage and wept for the happiness
that was for ever lost to her cousin Victor!

  CHAPTER XV.  
  
  
  EASTER SUNDAY.


You must not take a false idea of Madame
de Beauvoisin. She was not by any means a
sentimental person. She was, as I have said,
healthy in body and mind, she had that
cheerful temper which is the result of this physical
and mental equilibrium, and she was moreover
perpetually occupied.


There lies one of the chief sources of
whatever is best in France; the constant occupation
of the Avomen throughout the country. Inside
the barriers which inclose what is termed
constituted society, you will scarcely find an idle
woman. In the lower ranks, courage in toil is
a frequent and a never disregarded virtue, and
you can award a workwoman no higher praise
than to say that she is brave at her work.
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 213 -->
And God knows how brave they are, those
poor Avomen! and how they struggle and hoAv
they toil; and how, in the midst of all their
own life-battle, they contrive to feel for their
wounded comrades, and turn aside to help
them. And so, too, as you mount from class
to class of the social scale, in every division
you meet labour cheerfully undertaken, and
charity. Perhaps the portion of society which
is, in the latter respect, least Avorthy, is the
middle class. Of the higher and the lower
classes there can be no doubt they do more
than their duty. But, in order to state matters
fairly, let it be said that in the case of the
upper classes this has a reason: they are,
retrospectively as it were, on their promotion,
their object is to prove by present deserts the
injustice of the Past. Let that be, the good
done is enormous, and such as other nations
have but a small notion of. Whether that
good might be more wisely done is a question,
but if it might be, it assuredly will be, for the
great wheel of advancement cannot be stopped.
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 214 -->

As to the charity of the lower orders, from
it nothing can detract, and it springs from a
kindness of heart, from a ready sympathy Avith
suffering of which we know too little in our
island, so near in miles and so distant in mind
from our French neighbour.


Perhaps, the lukewarmness of the middle
classes (if there be such) in matters of charity
may be traceable to a commencement of
selfassertion not so frequent with continentals as
with ourselves; perhaps it may be the
beginning of a new social state of things in Avhich
less help will be afforded and more self-help
achieved. There lies a tremendous problem to
be solved.


At all events, in the actual condition of what
is termed in France the Avorld, a woman in
the position of Claire de Beauvoisin has
anything but a sinecure. In the first place, let
Avhat will be her amusements at night, she
invariably gets up early; and, let Avhat will be
the amount of her fortune, she keeps her house.
People are ruined in France as in England,
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 215 -->
but not in the same way; not ruined without
knowing it—sillily. You don't hear of families
going abroad, because, somehow, it seems that
they lived beyond their means. A Frenchman
who has hardly any means at all sometimes
speculates beyond his intelligence, and beyond
his luck; but if he have large means, regularly
to be disposed of, he seldom lives beyond them.
Of course I speak of the large majority of
families, and by a family I mean a married
man Avith his wife. Unmarried men Avould
seem, in French morality, to be accounted
irresponsible; all manner of follies and mistakes
are expected from them, which comes from the
separation of life into two parts,—one reputed
pleasant but not moral, the other reputed
moral but having no necessary right to any
pleasure.


Barring individual exceptions — of which a
large number are to be found to every rule in
every land—the large mass of French families
with means verging on wealth, live in
conditions of moral respectability surpassing what
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 216 -->
Ave designate by that word; and they owe this
to the activity, to the inflexible spirit of order,
and to the absence of all self-indulgence of
French women. A genuine French
gentlewoman regards self-indulgence, in no matter
Avhat degree, pitilessly, and recoils from
breakfasting in bed, for instance, as from a crime!
If you reflect upon this you may find in it the
reason for some contrasts which seem to you
irreconcilable.


Well, of these Avell-appointed, Avell-ordained
households, Olivier de Beauvoisin's was a
pattern; and in this lay Claire's satisfaction,
and in this consisted her ceaseless occupation.


The number of servants Avas considerable;
and there was not one over Avhose mode of
life the active and conscientious mistress of
the house did not watch. She was not
tiresome or importunate Avith her dependents, but
she made all around her feel that her support
would never fail them; and she spread over
the domestic community over Avhich she
presided a kind of atmosphere of maternal
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 217 -->
solicitude. Though remarkably quiet and gentle,
the young Marquise was very firm; and, among
those who served, none ever disobeyed her.
She was, perhaps, even more respected than
loved; but she was knoAvn by all to be justice
itself, and impossible to deceive.


With the habits of life this exercise of
government entails, with—added to the details of
organisation and internal economy—the hours set
apart for intellectual improvements and serious
reading, and the discharge of the onerous
duties attendant upon the direction of
charitable foundations, ■— with all this, honestly,
loyally, seriously carried out, it Avas difficult to
cultivate what, in the life of a woman with
more time on her hands, might have groAvn
into a grief or a passion.


Claire was not what romancers Avould call
madly in love with her cousin; she was not
even in love him. She loved him, as I
have already said, dearly, deeply—would
probably love him always; but she loved him as
a widow loves her dead, as the representative
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 218 -->
of unachievable happiness; and she had too
usefully busy a life to alloAv of any
sentimentality, of any idle melancholy. Still, as Claire
Avas a true woman, loving and tender, and
formed by nature to radiate over the plenteous
joys of a happy home, there were moments
Avhen the failures of her life Avere brought
home to her, and when the heart-sickness of
discouragement seized her. These moments
Avere rare and short-lived, and she quickly and
bravely surmounted them, and set to work
again cheerfully.


One of the worst of these moments for
Claire had been the being brought into such
suddenly close contact Avith Madame de
Mottefort on Good Friday, for to the feeling of her
own loneliness had been added the involuntary
conviction that Victor's life was wasted, and
Claire, avIio could master her own ills, Avas
weak at accepting those that should visit her
cousin. She shook off her own trouble, but
anxiety for his left a deeper mark than she
herself Avas aware of.
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 219 -->

When Claire de Beauvoisin summoned her
husband to church on Easter Sunday, she
seemed as perfect a specimen of womankind,
surrounded by its sweetest attributes, as it can
be given us to behold.


The church was near, and Olivier and his
Avife went to it on foot. So did most of the
neighbouring families. It was a bright, balmy
morning, and while the bells Avere ringing loud
for high mass, you might, upon the sunny
pavement of the adjacent streets, have met the
proudest society of the world, grouped together
in small knots, exchanging greetings as on the
return home from a journey (Lent is a sort of
expedition), and talking so familiarly of
subjects intimate, that a casual spectator would
ask himself if he were in the midst of some
provincial town. The talk Avas mostly of the
rigours of Lent, and of the way in which each
had supported them, and the joy and peace of
Easter sat upon nearly every face.


And Claire and Olivier. Look at them as
they approach, arm in arm; was ever a
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 220 -->
handsomer couple seen? they are so matched,
yet, as we knoAV, so sundered.


\"They are a charming sight," said a lovely
little old lady, all grey silk and Avhite lace;
"they took the communion together this
morning, at early mass. I could not help
Avatching them; it does one good to see—it's
an example." It Avas the same old lady Avho
had, when Olivier married Claire, hoped there
Avas just a little bit of love betAveen them!


"Yes, Madame la Vicomtesse," rejoined a
tall, stiff, thin old gentleman, with a
tightfitting, close-combed, shining dark wig, " it is
an example; and I rejoice to see that there is
great improvement in that respect. There is a
deal of religion in the young people of our
Avorld." The little Vicomtesse nodded assent,
as she and her veteran companion paced
measuredly on. " A deal of religion," resumed
the old gentleman, " more than in my youth
—I am ten years older than you, Madame
la Vicomtesse. The young people are well
brought up uoav a-days—severely. Look at
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 221 -->
Olivier, for instance. What a mother he
has!"


"My cousin Clavreuil is a saint," objected
the Vicomtesse.


\"Yes," retorted her friend; "but the Dowager
de Beauvoisin is a woman with a head—such a
head! Madame de Clavreuil is, as you say, a
saint; but so is the Dowager. Look again, I
say, at Olivier. What an education! There
he is, at nearly six-and-twenty, and as
submissive and respectful as a young girl. He
has never committed a folly yet; but, to be
sure, what a mother he has!"


\"They are a beautiful pair," murmured the
little old lady, reverting to her first idea; " and
they quite distracted my attention this morning
at early mass, when I saw them coming
together from the altar—a sweet sight."


Yes, it was true. No one was more exact in
the performance of his devotions throughout
the year than Olivier, and that morning he
had, as is very customary, taken the
communion at the same moment with his wife.
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 222 -->
And yet these two were no nearer! In that holy
Avord communion had they found no import ?


Of M. de Beauvoisin no complaint should
be made. He had been drilled, not educated;
premeditatively darkened by his trembling
instructors, and sent forth into the world with
a shut soul. But Claire ? Alas! she had
been so little used to believe that the love of
the inmost heart ought to bind man and Avife
together; that wedlock Avithout this love ought
to bear another and a very different name;
that she could kneel at the altar's foot, and,
Avith all the wrapt piety of a sincere and
ardent Catholic, commune with her God, yet
leave uncared for the poor, untaught, groping
soul of the man who knelt beside her, and was
her husband.


Yet in the world of Paris Olivier and Claire
were regarded as a pattern couple.


As they Avere crossing the street opening
into the square wherein stands the church, the
young Marquise observed a man, who had
stopped for an instant on the pavement
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 223 -->
opposite, cross rapidly in their direction. He was
a short, squat, red-cheeked, bushy-whiskered
man, vulgar in the extreme, with heavy gold
watch-chains, and pale yellow gloves, a man who
could not possibly have anything in common
with the world in which Olivier lived; yet he
came straight up to M. de Beauvoisin, put
out his fat hand to him, and then perceiving
the Marquise, took off his hat.


Olivier, having his wife on one arm,
preferred touching his hat with the other, to
accepting the proffered hand.


\"Glad to see you, M. le Marquis! hope
you're well!" said the vulgar-looking man.


Olivier bowed, muttered something in reply,
and availed himself of the pretext afforded him
by the number of persons on the pavement, to
move on, without entering into further parley;
but did not do so before Claire had had time
to remark the strange alteration of his face.
He had turned pale as death, and was now
red all over from the temples to the nape of
his neck.
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 224 -->

"Bon jour, Olivier! bonjour, Claire!"
exclaimed the Duchesse de Varignan, sprinkling
her words over them like scented water, and
half smothering them in the huge puffs of blue
silk and enormous bows of blue ribbon, which
SAvelled and fluttered upon all sides of her
looped-up dress; and she passed on Avithout
noticing the fact of her salutation having met
Avith no return.


"Who Avas that man?" asked the young
Marquise.


\"What man ? Avho ? " stammered M. de
Beauvoisin.


"The man aat1io spoke to you just now!"
added Claire.


\"Oh! that man—well—a man I once had
some dealings Avith—" and Olivier hesitated.
\"Some dealings with about wine," he said this
hurriedly, and apparently glad to have caught
hold of a reply.


Claire felt that this was not true, but could
pursue her inquiries no further. She was
annoyed, and prevented from concentrating
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 225 -->
her attention, as she wished to do, upon higher
things during the service in the church, by
recurrence to the offensive presence of the fat,
vulgar man who had dared to accost her
husband in the public street.


Her husband! the word then had some
sense beyond' that of the chief partner in a
social enterprise ? There was something in it
that forced the wife into oneness of feeling with
that one man and no other. Why ? Claire
could not have explained; but she suddenly
thought of her child, and felt that no
unpleasantness could disturb her son's father without
forcing her to vibrate to its touch.


In the child alone lies the unity between man
and wife in France.

  CHAPTER XVI.  
  
  
  MONSIEUR MARDONNET.


Educate a man as you will in France, keep
him to his books, make inquisitors of his
teachers, lock up his heart and soul, and if
you do not find means to lock up his body,
he Avill make strange acquaintances. And so
it had been Avith the Marquis de Beauvoisin;
and in this way he had come to know M.
Mardonnet.


At the small tOAvn of Malleray, Avhich Avas
the post-town of the Chateau de Beauvoisin,
{empty}M. Mardonnet, the father, had been
postmaster for nearly thirty years, and Avas once
a highly popular and very useful man. He
had been appointed to his post under Louis
Philippe, had preserved it through the
Republic, and occupied it still, at the opening
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 227 -->
of this tale. Both father and son, though
from different points of view, went over in
1851 to the paternal despotism of My Uncle's
Nephew, and voted enthusiastically for the
Empire. When it was done, the amusing part
of the business was that neither of the two
could comprehend why the other had done it,
each holding a diametrically contrary opinion
upon the benefits that were to accrue to France
from the establishment of Imperial Power.
Mardonnet the father insisted upon it, that
order would be for evermore maintained, that
a wholesome authority would keep down the
press, and that a period would be brought
about in which nothing more would have to be
feared from that so-called intelligence which
had long raged rampant in France, and brought
her to the \rerge of ruin. Mardonnet the son
affirmed that socialism would be the
Avatchword of the second empire, that the people
Avere going to rule, that all those who were
anything, or had anything, would go to the
wall and be crushed by the masses, Avhich,  
  
  
  Q 2
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 228 -->
he said, meant those who had nothing, and
were nothing. He represented the Emperor as
a socialist, a Freemason, and a free thinker,
and quoted texts by the hour from the
Emperor's own writings in proof of his assertions;
and when it was rumoured that he wrote in a
newspaper devoted to the propagation of
atheistical doctrines, he did not deny it. This it
was which, as we shall see by-and-by, first
brought M. Theophile into the sphere wherein
moved the faultlessly educated son of the
DoAvager de Beauvoisin.


Olivier de Beauvoisin rejoiced in a tutor
whom his mother had chosen for him as
particularly safe. This Avas a certain Abbe*
Lannion, not a bad man by any means, but
rather zealous than wise, and deeming
everything allowable that was undertaken for the
glory of the church. Noav it Avas borne in upon
the worthy Abbe's mind that he must convert
Theophile Mardonnet, and to this Avork of
conversion he accordingly set: secretly, but with
tooth and nail. The DoAvager Avas, as Ave
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 229 -->
know, a sharp Avoman; but she reposed such
implicit confidence in the Abbe Lannion
that, where he was concerned, her sharpness
deliberately slumbered, and so long as his
pupil was with him, she inquired no further.
In pursuance of his idea, carried away by it,
and imbued with the genuine Jesuitical theory
that the means justify the end, the Abbe
Lannion contrived to effect a meeting, to all
appearance perfectly casual, with Theophile
Mardonnet; and displaying a large amount of
cleverness in a small way, he managed to
prosecute what he imagined to be his great
work, entirely to his own satisfaction, never
once perceiving the game that his adversary
was playing with him. The upshot of the
whole was that the devil was the Avinner, there
where the church was to have reaped such
evident gains. Theophile Mardonnet was too
well endowed with that species of coarse
cleverness, for which men of his stamp are so
remarkable in France, not to see that, while the
hope of converting him was the bait which
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 230 -->
drew the unlucky Abbe Lannion into his net,
his — Theophile Mardonnet's — OA\-n interest
pointed to the young Marquis as to a natural
piece of prey.


Mardonnet was turned thirty; Olivier Avas
not yet nineteen; and it Avas by a rapid and
summary process that Theophile Mardonnet
arrived at the conclusion that the young
Marquis de Beauvoisin was put upon this earth to
become his natural prey. He just placed in
juxtaposition in his mind's eye a feAv
leadingfacts, asked himself a few necessary questions,
and was satisfied. Olivier was a minor, and
enjoyed an alloA\Tance, for every centime of
which he had to account to his mother—
(a tough party the DoAA'ager, and not to be
meddled AATith !) Olivier, at his majority, Avould
enjoy something like three hundred thousand
francs a year (£12,000 English—a large
fortune in France). Olivier Avas a fool—a
blockhead, rather. That was M. Theophile's way
of putting it.  
  
  
  And then he asked himself these questions :
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 231 -->
—Had Olivier any principle? No. Had he
any amusements? No. Did he want any?
No. Was he perfectly healthy and vigorous ?
Yes. Was he content with his vegetable life ?
Yes. Was that because he knew no better ?
Yes. Well, then, he must be made to know
better, that was all. And to this task of
mental improvement Theophile Mardonnet
set himself with the whole power and volition
of his coarse nature, and that was a good deal,
and he succeeded beyond what he had
ventured to anticipate.


A very few fragments of conversation with
Olivier (brought about in the back parlour of
the post office) sufficed to show to M. Theophile
what was the calibre of the lad's mind; and
it was but too easy for him to fashion the raw
material of which he found himself suddenly
possessed. He began by lending him books
and plays to read, which the boy concealed
with admirable dexterity, devoured till he
knew whole pages of them by heart, and
returned, without any one around him being
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 232 -->
one bit the wiser. This of itself wras
promising; and though the youth's nature was not a
passionate, it might, as the wrily preceptor
thought, be made a vicious one. Opportunities
were promptly created by Theophile Mardonnet,
for the prize he had secured seemed to him
worth taking any amount of trouble about; and
so he played the game of sanctity freely into
the Abbe's hands, and the latter was soon
convinced that he had had a direct inspiration
from above when he undertook to convert the
postmaster's son.


To say the real truth, the Abbe Lannion
was at last disposed to regard Monsieur
Theophile as a fit subject for the heartfelt
compassion of saints, and himself as a sort of
earthly manifestation of the Divine light
which turns Sauls into Pauls. M. Theophile
stuck at nothing, and did write noAv and then
an article for the Portier du Paradis (a journal
founded expressly to defend St. Peter, and
which was as wrathful as the Syllabus itself
against all christians in general Avho Avere
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 233 -->
not its subscribers); and he confided in private
to his ecclesiastical friend that he had cured
himself of toothache by an application of the
water of La Salette !


\"But," said he, "I am a ruined man if any
living being guess at these facts—for my daily
bread is earned in the camp of the infidels—
and if it should be knoAvn that grace has
touched me, I must die of starvation, and be
calumniated, probably, on both sides into the
bargain."


{empty}M. Theophile's spiritual effusions, therefore,
Avere signed by a fictitious name—which was
contrary to law; but, as the Portier du
Paradis wras not read by a hundred persons,
no alarm Avas felt as to prosecution; and if
any danger had threatened, the Abbe Lannion
Avould have declared himself the real author,
rather than allow his convert to suffer for
having come back to the right path. It was
agreed that, on the return of the family to
Paris for the winter, the Abbe should use all
his influence in the ultramontane press to
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 234 -->
obtain for Monsieur Theophile a lucrative post
upon the staff of some right-thinking paper,
in whose columns, as from a tribune, the
reclaimed sinner might flagellate with all his
new-born fervour his old associates in impiety.


"Then!" said M. The'ophile, "lean be at
liberty to cast in the teeth of the infidels the
ill-gotten gold by which, until then, I must
subsist! "


"Then! " exclaimed the exultant Abbe
Lannion, " I can boldly triumph in my work, sIioav
my fellow labourers in the fields of faith Avhat
I have done, and reveal all to Madame la
Marquise ! Hoav Madame la Marquise will rejoice
over you!" he invariably added, as though
in that notion lay his chiefest satisfaction.


Winter came on. It was quite the beginning
of the year, and one day M. Theophile was
sitting in his small room on the fourth floor in
the Rue St. Anne, building up his fire Avith all
the stray bits of wood he could pick up Avith his
tongs, and ruminating in his conscience what
might be his probable resources for the next
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 235 -->
six months. It was between three and four
o'clock. A ring came at the door-bell—not a
loud one. " Some confounded creditor," thought
Mardonnet. His housekeeper, the shuffling,
snuff-taking old woman who did for him from
eight o'clock till two, was gone, and he was
alone. A second ring came at the door-bell,
but rather louder. Mardonnet got up, hesitated,
looked bothered, reflected that creditors came
mostly in the earlier part of the day, and made
up his mind to open. When he had done so,
his whole aspect changed. A wide gleam of
contentment lighted up his vulgar countenance,
and exclaiming,—


\"Monsieur le Marquis ! What an honour
you do me! " He retraced his steps, bowing
profoundly, and ushering M. de Beauvoisin
into his sitting-room, redolent with the fumes of
tobacco. Olivier held out his hand, seated
himself in the one tolerably comfortable arm-chair,
and Mardonnet bravely sacrificed a whole log
of wood to make the fire brighter.  
  
  
  " I resolved I would pay you a visit,"
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 236 -->
commenced the Marquis, graciously; " but, as you
knoAV, it is not so easy to manage. There are
but two days in the Aveek Avhere, by a
combination, it can be done; but I made the
combination, and I have managed it very Avell. I am
supposed to be at the fencing school," he added,
with a look of great superiority. " I go there
alone—I mean Avithout the Abbe. Roger
de Damville, and Adrien de Villecour, and I,
we take our lesson on Tuesdays and Saturdays
together; and Roger's ill in bed with typhus
fever, so Adrien and I are alone; besides Avhich
my mother is at home all day on a
Tuesdayshe receives—so I was quite safe, for I can
trust Adrien to any amount."


Olivier was embarrassed, and spoke volubly,
and more than was his Avont; and Theophile
noted all these small signs as he sat Avatching
his visitor, with his plump hands crossed upon
his plump chest.


\"I'm sincerely touched by your
remembrance of me, I'm sure," murmured Mardonnet;
\"but at your age the feelings are warm, and it
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 237 -->
really is very kind of you to mount up my four
pair of stairs, and to contrive to escape, too,
from the thralls in which you are held; for,"
(here M. Theophile gave a cautious expression
to his voice) "you are certainly tightly held.
Of course, I would not venture to criticise any
system adopted by so superior a person as
Madame la Marquise; but still the fact is
certain, you are tightly held," propounded
Mardonnet.


\"Very," responded the young Marquis; " but
you see what makes it bearable is, that it is the
same for all. Now there are, as I said, Roger
and Adrien, and a heap more I could mention,
they're all brought up just in the same way."


\"And they all of them manage to elude a
little the yoke that is put upon their necks ? "
suggested mildly M. Theophile, with a half
interrogative tone.


\"Well, just a little," replied Olivier, " now
and then, and just to have a sort of feeling of
being free for an hour or tAvo. There's no
great harm in that, after all."
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 238 -->

\"Harm! " echoed his plump friend; "
certainly not. There will never be any harm in
anything you do," he added, calming the timid
conscience of the boy.


There Avas a pause, during Avhich Olivier
accepted a cigar; smoking, as he related, being
permitted by the Dowager, and the Abbe
declaring it a most innocent occupation. (I
have told you the Abbe was, in his own opinion,
a man who Avent with his times.)


\"I have brought back the book you lent me
just before we left the country," observed
Olivier, taking out of his pocket a small
yellowbound volume, that he would have been far the
better for never having read.  
  
  
  " Did you find it amusing ? " asked M.Theophile.


\"Tremendously ! " answered Olivier; "
delightful ! I lent it to Adrien, and to Gaston de
Vivienne; that's why I've kept it so long. And—"
here he paused, and looking straight into the
fire, puffed a huge puff of smoke from his lips.  
  
  
  " And you would like to have another of the
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 239 -->
same sort, perhaps?" hinted, blandly, M.
Mardonnet.


\"N—o, n—o," stammered the Marquis;
"but there certainly is something we should
all three of us like very much."


His voice sank to a whisper as he uttered
these words, and he drew his chair nearer to
{empty}M. Theophile.


"Anything I can do?" inquired that wily
individual.


\"Oh, yes; something you can easily, easily
do," rejoined Olivier, with, for him,
considerable eagerness. But there he came to a
standstill, and could get no further.


\"You know my utter devotion to you," said
Mardonnet, trying to bring on the confession
he had long foreseen. " Anything I can, I will
do for you."


\"Can you take us behind the scenes of the
Porte St. Martin?" blustered out the youth
with desperation.


\"Mercy ! " cried M. Theophile; " what a
request! "
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 240 -->

"Is it impossible?" pursued the Marquis,
hurriedly, and noAv that the ice was once
broken, plunging into the stream up to the
very neck; " is it so very difficult ? We Avant
to go all three—Adrien, and Gaston, and I,
and on some night Avhen they give the Biche
aux Bois. Nobody will ever know; Ave three
shall keep the secret—you may count on us :
but can you do it?"


\"There is no difficulty for me," said M.
Theophile, self-sufficiently; " but, really, the
notion is quite an adventurous one. Oh,
youth, youth! you knoAV not what you seek
for! "


\"We Avant to see Mile. Camille Leblond,"
continued Olivier, whom nothing seemed now
capable of stopping on the path of sublunary
dissipation.


\"Whew! no less than that, young
gentlemen !" and M. Theophile pursed up his lips,
and rounded his eyes, and looked the picture
of astonishment. "Mile. Camille Leblond!"
he repeated; " but that costs money. Your
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 241 -->
allowances are scanty, and have to be accounted
for, every farthing of them ! "


'Well, we could go shares," suggested
Olivier. " To begin with, we could get you to
buy us a splendid bouquet for her—each of us
could give ten francs. A bouquet of thirty
francs ! " urged Olivier, thinking what lavish
expenditure that was. "A bouquet of thirty
francs! we could manage that between us,
each giving ten francs. I could account for it
at the end of the month by buying a box of
bonbons of five francs for Aunt d'Herincourt,
and putting it down fifteen."


Alas! Theophile Mardonnet had a lengthy
explanation to give upon the financial
combinations that would be requisite in case he
introduced these lawless young gentlemen to one of
the reigning stars of that period; but Olivier's
mind seemed made up, and the more objections
were made, the less he listened to them.


He agreed to everything. The plan involved
a secret egress from the Hotel de Beauvoisin
after every one Avas asleep at night, and a secret  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  r.
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 242 -->
ingress to it before anyone was awake in the
morning, besides numberless other clangers;
but no excuse was accepted, and Mardonnet
was forced to admit that, with plenty of money,
this, like most other things in the Avorld, was
possible. But plenty of money ! how was that
to be got ?


"Well," insinuated M. Theophile, "if it
were positively necessary, I could get that,
too."


The reader hardly needs to be told that
Theophile Mardonnet had hooked his fish.


Mademoiselle Camille Leblond did all that
was left to do.


This episode occurred, as has been stated,
six or seven years previous to Olivier's marriage
with Claire. He was then a boy of nineteen,
and Theophile Mardonnet Avas a man turned
thirty.
<!-- Leaf 255 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVH.  
  
  
  MADEMOISELLE ASPASIE.


On Easter Tuesday, the day but one after we
have seen Olivier de Beauvoisin and his wife
going to high mass at their parish church, the
fat, vulgar man, whom Claire had been so
surprised to see accost her husband in the public
street, was walking along one of the side-alleys
of the park at Versailles; one of the
unfrequented ones, leading obliquely from the Tapis
Vert to the Jardin du Roi. He was not alone;
a remarkably well-dressed woman was walking
by his side, attired in black silk not over
bespangled with jet-beads, and through the
meshes of whose spotted veil came the flashes
of two brilliantly black eyes. The face was a
well-favoured, though not an agreeable one,
and its expression, as far as it could be  
  
  
  R 2
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 244 -->
made out, seemed more sharp even than
bold.


\"We can sit down here; we are quite out of
the way of any Easter excursionists," said this
person, in whose harsh voice is revealed to us
our friend, Mademoiselle Aspasie de
Mourjonville. The man who was thus addressed obeyed,
and the couple sat down upon a bench in the
middle of the unpeopled avenue.


\"Well! and how did my worshipful sister
accept the notion of being torn away from all
her barbaric admirers ?" asked she of the
speckled veil, as soon as she had settled her
skirts to her satisfaction.


\"Accept ? " repeated her companion, " why,
I thought I had explained to you that she
Avas the first to pine and sicken to come
back "


"What do you mean, Theophile?"
interrupted Mademoiselle Aspasie, with extreme
surprise. "Why, she will get no boyards
here! she's terribly faded now, the lovely
Camille! "
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 245 -->

\"No boyards, no ! " echoed the fat man with
a grunt; " but she gets the Boulevards, and so
do I!"


\"So there's patriotism in your return, is
there?" observed Mademoiselle Mourjon,
otherwise de Mourjonville, with a sneer. " Well!
of a certainty that is about the very last luxury
in which I should have thought either of you
tAvo would have indulged !" and the sneer was
biting in both the look and the tone.


\"Ah! but you don't know what it is to a
Parisian to think that he's going to make his
home, his living and dying place, of a
barbarous country where they only speak
makebelieve French, and where there's nothing
one's ever been used to; neither minor theatres,
nor newspapers, nor talk! neither a real cafe
(like these here), nor the Boulevards, nor a
pot-au-feu!" and Theophile Mardonnet
positively did look as though he had been suffering
martyrdom, as though St. Peter had emptied
the phials of his utmost wrath upon his head,
for not having more seriously taken up his
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 246 -->
cause some years before in the columns of the
Portier du Paradis.


Mademoiselle de Mourjonville tightened her
Avell-fitting tight glove over her long thin hand,
and looked an odd kind of look at her neighbour.


\"I think if I had had Camille's position,"
remarked she, "I could have renounced the
delights of this enchanting paradise."


"No! you couldn't!" opposed, energetically,
Mardonnet. " You could'nt in the long run."


"Not for lots of money?" asked
Mademoiselle Aspasie.


\"Not for anything under the sun," affirmed
her interlocutor; "besides, though money is
easy to gain out there, it is easy to spend, too;
everything is horribly dear."


\"They play, don't they?" said Aspasie,
curiously.


\"Yes ! they play day and night, and Avhat's
more, they pay nine times out of ten, especially
Avhen the money's owed to a foreigner; but it's
all no use! two hundred a year in Paris is
better than two thousand a year in
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 247 -->
MoldoWallachia. Pah! AAdiat a den for a man of
education to live in!" and Mardonnet shuddered
as only a Frenchman can shudder when in a
moment of severe hunger, for instance, he has
the choice given him between starvation and
some outlandish dish, wherein eels and
lemonjuice, cream, apples, and beer, combine together!


Mademoiselle Mourjon seemed to be
reflecting upon something, and, after a pause,—■


\"Yes," said she, echoing Mardonnet's last
Avords; "a man of education, forsooth : there's
the rub! That's what you think yourself."


\"Aspasie !" exclaimed her stout companion,
Avith such an explosion of offended dignity;
but she cut that short by a quiet laugh,
beneath the sound of which he utterly collapsed.


\"Pray does the lovely Camille still honour
me with the same jealousy as heretofore?" she
continued.


\"I hardly know. I think it safest never to
mention your name."


\"Bravo! a piece of admirable prudence;
and what I think decidedly safest and best, in
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 248 -->
the present state of affairs. But, Theophile,
in the name of all Avorldly Avisdom, Avhat could
have induced you to go and pounce straight
upon the Marquis, as you tell me you did?
And in the public street, too! before the pick
of society!" and Mile. Aspasie indulged in
another sneer of incomparable bitterness.


"AVhat would you?" rejoined Theophile,
with an exculpatory shrug; "I couldn't help
myself. I Avas just fresh home, and, when I
caught sight of him, it actually seemed to
remind me of old times, and I went straight
up to him before I knew what I was about."


\"Old times!" said Mile. Aspasie,
mockingly; " nice old times to remember, indeed !"


\"Nobody noticed anything," objected
Mardonnet; "he moved away before anybody saw
me accost him."


"Well, but he?" retorted Aspasie. "Do
you suppose he will have been particularly
rejoiced to realise the fact of your return to
France?"  
  
  
  " An impulse! one can't control one's
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 249 -->
impulses. Besides," he added, "the Marquis is
his own master now, and "  
  
  
  His companion cut him short.


\"He's very little more his own master than
he ever was," she observed. "His wife's at
the head of his house, and his mother's at the
head of him. He don't care for being master
over anything, not even his stables."


"Not even his heart?" inquired Theophile
Mardonnet, with a smile.


"Hasn't got any," rejoined the lady. " Heart
indeed! well, to be sure, a pretty thing you
have hit upon! Heart ? Why, where do you
suppose that should come from?"


\"Well, it is a fact that you sometimes find
it in the very worst men," opined M. Theophile,
as though to excuse his want of knoAvledge of
human nature.


\"In the very worst?" echoed Mile. Aspasie;
\"I should think so. But M. le Marquis de
Beauvoisin is as far from the very worst as
from the very best. He's simply nothing at
all decidedly; scarcely even half and half. But
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 250 -->
so they are all—all those of his kind. He's
fonder than I am of finery; likes fine things
and fine people; and judges Avomen as a
Avoman does, upon their dress. He's bored
Avith everything; and might, perhaps, be moved
to sacrifice whatever he possesses upon earth
if he could be delivered from his OAvn
wearisome self. There's not a passion in him yet.
I suppose vice will get hold of him later; vice
requires no energy."


"Yes," said Mardonnet; "I thought it had
done so already; but he slipped back under
his mother's wing as easily after he had tasted
of the forbidden fruit as before."


\"By Avhich the devil loses nothing,"
remarked, parenthetically, the Avell-dressed young
person in black. " But let me tell you,
Theophile, I Avould advise you not to come within
sight of the Dowager; for, if you do, depend
upon it, you will very shortly find yourself
exiled again from your beloved Boulevards,
and inducted into some lucrative but
compulsory employment at three thousand miles'
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 251 -->
distance from your ardently - adored
fatherland."


"I am not afraid of the Dowager," replied,
quietly, M. Theophile.


"Aren't you?" retorted Mile. Aspasie, with
a curious glance. " Then it's because you
don't know her sufficiently."


\"No, it's not that," answered Mardonnet,
with a significant shake of the head. " I do
knoAV her better than most people, and a good
deal better than she knows me, for instance;
but I've that on hand which prevents my being
afraid of the Dowager."


\"Theophile ! " cried, suddenly, Mile.
Mourjon, turning round and facing her stout friend;
\"you don't mean to say that you're in league
with her, do you, about Claudine ? "


"What!" exclaimed he, with a start; "in
league, did you say? I in league with the
Marquise ? I! Well, that Avould be a strange
event, after what is past; and about Claudine ?
Why, what on earth do you mean?"  
  
  
  " What I mean is this," stated the fair
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 252 -->
Aspasie, deliberately; and, at the same time,
folloAving Avith great attention the pattern she
was drawing upon the gravel with the tip of
her boot. " What I mean is, that that Avoman
is capable of anything in order to detach her
brother from Claudine—in order to make him
cast her off, She Avould enter into a compact
with anyone: with Mazzini or Renari, or
Georges Sand, or M. Duruy, or Satan himself,
or a chimney-SAveeper, or you, if she thought
she could achieve that end. So it struck me
that perhaps—■—"


"No, indeed," interrupted Mardonnet;
"nothing in that way. I have had no
communication, direct or indirect, Avith the DoAvager, nor
do I need to have any. The Marquis is legally
his OAA-n master now, Avhatever he may be
morally; so that his despot of a mother does
not come into play; nor," he pursued, after a
pause, "does he himself, for that matter. I
don't fancy he Avill court me. I have no
particular desire to court him; the pavement
of Paris is broad enough for us both, Avithout
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 253 -->
our being jostled up against each other, and
my line is not his line."


\"And pray, may I ask, what is your line to
be?" demanded Mile, de Mourjonville,
somewhat disdainfully.


\"Politics," propounded Mardonnet; and as
he uttered the word, he seemed to swell
inwardly. Mile. Aspasie drew herself up, raised
her eyebrows to their utmost arch, surveyed
her companion all over, and, in a tone
not complimentary, certainly, repeated the
word,—  
  
  
  "Politics?"


"Well, and why not?" asked, hastily, M.
Theophile. " Are not politics now the field in
which every man of any capacity can exercise
his talents?"  
  
  
  "No," put in Aspasie.


\"Look at the ministers who govern us,"
went on Mardonnet, unheeding her negation;
\"who among them has sprung from a higher
source?"  
  
  
  "Oh!" laughed she, " if you go to such
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 254 -->
heights as those, T withdraw my opposition.
We may, for aught I know, see you one clay
minister of commerce, or agriculture, or justice
even, or prefect of police; that would be the
best of all. Well, I at once register my claim
to a bureau de tabac in Paris! Mind, in Paris,
in a central situation, whenever you become an
Excellency."  
  
  
  "Don't talk nonsense, Aspasie."


\"I never did, and you know it," said she,
with biting sharpness.


\"Well," responded Mardonnet, meekly, " I
don't mean that; but my chances are so
capital that I should be a fool to throAv them
away. You knoAV who is made sub-prefect at
Malleray."  
  
  
  "Not I. Who?"


\"Well, Marius Daudel, the greatest friend I
ever had—"


\"What; the man who was for founding that
paper to be entitled the Bed Flag, and who
was nearly condemned for swindling?" inquired
Aspasie. " Mind, I'm not raising an objection
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 255 -->
—nothing astonishes me—I'm only seeking for
information."


\"Yes, the same man," answered Theophile.
"He is in tremendous favour at the Ministry
of, and is now sub-prefect of Malleray.
This it is in reality, which (besides
home-sickness) brought me home. I wrote to Marius
the moment I knew of his nomination, and
told him of my intention to return. He has
nothing to refuse me."  
  
  
  " Oh, I dare say not,


\"Added to which," continued Mardonnet,
\"you know the Minister of is my
mother's first cousin; so, as I said, I have
the best chances."  
  
  
  "Of what?" inquired, calmly, Mile.Mourjon.


\"Of being made a deputy at the next
elections."  
  
  
  "For what locality, may I ask?"  
  
  
  " For the department of Savre-et-Merle.


\"Are you mad, Theophile?" cried Aspasie,
jumping from her seat, and standing in front of
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 256 -->
that individual, and looking him all over with
a sort of mixture of contempt and dismay.
\"Are you mad ? For Savre-et-Merle ? What,
the Marquise's own department? the
department for which she will infallibly one clay
put up her son, and in which she reigns
supreme?"


"The department whereof Malleray is one of
the three head-quarters, and where the Minister
of will move heaven and earth for his
cousin's son," rejoined Mardonnet.


\"How do you know that? The Beauvoisins
can do anything they like there, and the
Marquis will crush you."


\"The Beauvoisins will not succeed in
Savreet-Merle," remarked M. Theophile, " because
they're too clerical. There will be two
elections in the two nearest departments that will
go to the fanatics and be ultramontane pure—
a third would be too much. I shall come in
as a free-thinker—a Republican, if you -will;
but a Republican who loves dictators, and the
rights of thought, and all that sort of thing.
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 257 -->
I am sure of my election, and the Marquis will
not crush me."  
  
  
  " He will, you'll see.


\"You'll see he won't," retorted M. Theophile,
"for he won't attempt to oppose me."


\"There's no saying what he may do; he
may go in for being what they call a Liberal.
That man, Dupont de Laporte, may make him
do something nobody expects."


Mardonnet again shook his head. " He will
not oppose me, take my word for it," he
reiterated, as he offered his arm to his
companion, to continue their walk.


After a few steps taken in silence,
Mademoiselle de Mourjonville came to a stand,
and looked her stout friend through and
through.


"Theophile," said she; "you fancy the
Marquis will not oppose you?" and after a
pause of a second,—"then there was more
happened seven years ago than I knew of; I
should like to know what."  
  
  
  As this worthy pair moved on, M. Theophile  
  
  
  VOL. I.  
  
  
  s
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 258 -->
  
  might be seen bending down to touch with his
thick lips the hand that rested on his arm,
AAdiile the said thick lips murmured, " You
always did Avith me whatever you chose,,
Aspasie!"
<!-- Leaf 271 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVIII.  
  
  
  THE DOWAGER.


Our friend, Mademoiselle de Mourjonville,
was thoroughly in the right when she said that
the Dowager de Beauvoisin was capable of
anything in order to detach her brother from the
Sphinx. She had already done something very
abnormal when she not only permitted, but in
fact advised, her son to enter into his uncle's
intimacy, and consequently to accept in a
certain degree, the hospitality of a person
doing; the honours of the Hotel de Moranses,
in a position so utterly unavowable as that of
Claudine.


There was no show in the Hotel de
Moranges, but there was no end to the expenses
over which the severest taste invariably
presided. The familiars of the place were wont  
  
  
  s 2
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 260 -->
to point to a small ebony table with four
straight legs, for which M. de Moranges had
paid exactly double the price given by a
famous Brazilian millionnaire for a great big
flaunting table encrusted Avith precious stones.
And this was the rule observed in all things.
From the moment that the Marquis put
himself at the head of a house, and openly
entertained the masculine portion of society, he
resolved that no one should be able to say
that he had seen the magnificence of the
entertainment surpassed. If, at the sale of
some noted gallery there was some one
particular picture for which governments (let alone
Lord Hertford) Avere likely to bid extravagantly
high, that picture was certain to be bought by
{empty}M. de Moranges; and if a thousand pounds
could purchase a matchless saddle-horse, or if
four thousand were needed to secure four
incomparable, and all but identical
carriagehorses, the sum Avould be given instantly, the
team driven by the owner, but no fuss made
about it. All this leads, as the Dowager well
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 261 -->
knew, to a perilous state of things, as far as
regards finances; and the fortune, which she
had determined should descend unimpaired to
her grandson, seemed in a likely way to be,
sooner or later, SAvalloAved up by unavoidable
ruin.


Madame de Beauvoisin saw no escape,
save in the possibility of detaching her
brother from the Sphinx. But how was this
to be managed ? The first necessity was, as
we have said, to be thoroughly well informed
as to the minutest details of daily life at the
Hotel de Moranges. But the information
given to her by Olivier, after she had gone
the length of advising him to cultivate his
uncle's society in the interior presided over
by Claudine, was unsatisfactory in the
extreme. It plainly resulted from all Olivier's
reports that the interior of the Hotel de
Moranges was, except for its splendour, the
quietest, most uneventful, and, indeed, most
austere that could be imagined—a pattern to be
imitated by the most unexceptionable families.
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 262 -->
She was not a bit the wiser for anything
told to her by Olivier; and, indeed, at the end
of a very short time, Olivier ceased telling her
anything at all. There Avas, on the surface,
nothing to tell; we may ask, was there nothing
beneath ? but the Dowager did not do so; and
she Avas at her wit's end, and did not knoAV
whom to apply to for aid.


\"Is that Avoman attached to him ?" she
inquired one day of Count Dupont de
Laporte.


\"She doesn't know," replied Dupont, with a
smile; " and therefore I am somewhat troubled
to decide."


\"You don't, for a moment, fancy that he is
attached to her, do you?" demanded, sharply,
the Dowager.


Count Dupont fixed a meaning glance full
upon the questioner, and said,—


\"Madame la Marquise, this lies more in
your domain than in mine : have you ever had
cause to suppose that M. de Moranges could
attach himself to any one ? "
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 263 -->

"Hitherto, certainly not," was the answer;
\"but he lavishes proofs of what people call
affection upon her, does he not?"


"None that I have seen—as yet," responded
Henri; "he lavishes proofs of affection upon
himself, whereof she is the mere sign."


\"But he'll be ruined in a couple of years,"
suggested the Dowager.


\"He's more likely to be insane in half that
time."


\"Insane ! " she echoed : " what should give
you such a preposterous notion ? Maurice
insane, indeed!"


\"Do you suppose, Madame la Marquise,"
rejoined, ironically, Count Dupont, " that the
fact of being the heir of all the Moranges since
Clovis is any guarantee against such an
infliction ? What gives me this preposterous notion,
as you style it, is experience, and some slight
knowledge of physiology."


\"Physiology ! Pah! " sneered the Dowager,
turning up her nose.  
  
  
  Henri Dupont bowed.
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 264 -->

\"May be," observed he, coolly; " but
physiology has its usefulness all the same."


"Is it true about the Russian diamond?"
asked the Dowager.


\"Perfectly true; he paid it, five hundred
thousand francs down, and Claudine has worn
it at nearly every dinner I have been invited
to at your brother's house. She mostly wears
it on a plain black velvet dress, or on a Avhite
velvet one, Avdiich is another of his whims. It
is mounted so as to show no mounting, and
looks like a star dropped down from the sky.
Poor Claudine," added Dupont; " she can't
understand that simplicity, it makes her
uncomfortable. She would like her big diamond
much better if it were a paste one set round
with a thick gold rim and lots of coloured
stones."


\"What is the woman who goes about with
her?" demanded the Dowager.


Count Dupont de Laporte's countenance
underwent a change. " Oh! that is quite
another thing," said he, seriously. "Aspasie
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 265 -->
Mourjon, called Mademoiselle Aspasie de
Mourjonville, is altogether another sort of
person. She patronizes me hugely, and I
sometimes stare in astonishment at the native
intelligence of the woman. If M. de Moranges
had put her in Claudine's place, I should
tremble—tremble for your party, Madame la
Marquise, for, I believe, he would be a great
statesman yet, and govern France—that woman
is first-rate."  
  
  
  " And corrupt, of course ? "


\"That depends on the sense lent to the
Avord: in the ordinary sense no, for she is
wholly passionless—but she is full of
perversity 


\"And Avould do anything for money,"
interrupted the Marquise.


"Well," and he hesitated; "I fancy she
would do almost anything for money—but
more for ambition; she's a curious compound,
and amuses me immensely; but take my word
for it, she is no every day woman."  
  
  
  " Ah!" the Marquise did lay down her
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 266 -->
knitting on her knee this time, drawled out her
exclamation lengthily, and kept her eyes fixed
on Count Dupont with so intense a gaze that
they seemed to look through him, and go
far far away into some distant speculative
thought.


Count Dupont took out his watch and rose
from his seat. " I must make haste," said he;
"lam past the time I settled to meet a man at
the club. I have the honour to present my
homage to you, Madame la Marquise," and he
advanced toAvards the Dowager, and offered her
his hand.


\"Tell me, what was that wonderful fete
Maurice gave last week at St. Germain ? " she
inquired, still holding Henri Dupont's hand.


\"Oh ! something positively Sardanapalian,"
replied he; "a banquet in a pavilion built up
on purpose in the forest, a torchlight
procession, fireworks, special trains, heaven only
knows what all! it must have cost him forty
or fifty thousand francs or more, for there
was a theatre, Avith the orchesta of the
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 267 -->
Conservatoire, and scenes sung by Faure and
the Nilsson."


\"How abominable ! what was the object of
it all ? " exclaimed the angry Dowager.


\"To show a Hungarian Count of his
acquaintance, just arrived from Pesth, what a
French gentleman can do when he sets about
it; but Olivier can tell you more of the details
of that than I can, for he had to play the
attentive the whole time to Claudine, Moranges
being devoted to his Hungarian guest. I took
charge of my friend Aspasie Mourjon, and do
not in the least complain of my lot—ask
Olivier, he will tell you all, I must go."


And, so saying, he departed, leaving the
Dowager dissatisfied Avith Olivier for not
having told her what it seemed there had
been to tell.
<!-- Leaf 280 -->
  
  CHAPTER XIX.  
  
  
  THE DEPUTATION.


A very few days after her conversation with
Count Dupont de Laporte, the DoAvager
received a letter which caused her to send to her
brother in all haste. He was out; and, towards
seven o'clock, the ansAver brought was, that he
would come to her as soon as he was free after
dinner.


It Avas in a boudoir which, under any other
woman's hands would have been cosy, but
Avhich, under her treatment, Avas unhomely,
that the Marquise awaited her brother that
evening. It Avas a most methodically arranged
apartment, in Avhich nothing Avas out of its
place, nor looked as if it ever, at any period of
time, could have been so. The tables all stood
square, and the chairs stood stiff, as though
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 269 -->
Avaiting for occupants wTho were coming to sign
some deed.


There were no flowers, and no nick-nacks,
nothing betraying a female presence; above
all, none of that sweet subtle perfume which—
no matter what her age—seems the natural
emanation of a womanly-woman's whereabouts;
— the soul, as it were, of all the combined
prettinesses surrounding her. There was a
lamp upon a table in the middle of the room,
and the Dowager sat under its rays, with her
perpetual white wool knitting work; and the
shaded light did not soften the hard outlines of
her face, or the hard glance of her eyes, or the
hard lustre of her coal-black hair.


The Marquise looked thoughtful; and, from
time to time, suspended her work and bit the
tip of her ivory knitting-needle. At about
a quarter to ten the Marquis de Moranges
entered.


\"Bring the tea," said the Dowager; and,
before she had concluded the greetings
exchanged with her brother, two silent men, one
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 270 -->
in black, the other in livery, served tea in
Sevres cups, on silver trays, with all its usual
accessories. The Marquise had never in all
her life made tea. She took it, as she did
many things which womanly-women fashion
after their own image, ready made.


When this social ceremony was ended, and
the door closed on all interruption,—


\"Cher ami" said the Dowager, very blandly,
\"I have sent for you upon a really important
matter. I would not have troubled you
otherAvise."


"lam entirely at your orders," replied the
Marquis, with prompt politeness. " What has
happened ? "


\"That man, Carpentier, has had an apoplectic
fit. There's Durochard's letter."


And she put out her hand to take an
envelope lying under her white wool upon the
table.  
  
  
  " What, Leon Carpentier, our deputy ? "  
  
  
  " Yes."  
  
  
  " Is he dead ? " inquired M. de Moranges.
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 271 -->

\"No; he's better. You will see what
Durochard Avrites about."


' Why, what age was he ? " continued the
Marquis, following out an idea of his own,
without reading the letter. " I don't believe
he was much past fifty."


\"He was under fifty," responded the
DoAvager; " but that doesn't matter."
(Perhaps M. de Moranges thought it did). " What
does matter is, that this is a warning—fits of
this kind always are—and that Carpentier's
days are evidently numbered; and, that being
the case, we must be prepared."  
  
  
  The Marquis smiled.


\"You always are so, my dear sister," said
he. "I never knew you unprepared for
anything yet. Of course you allude to the
Deputation ? "


\"Naturally," Avas the reply; "and that was
why I was in such a hurry to see you. We
have not an hour to lose. I want to write to
Durochard by to-morrow's post, for, unless I
can positively rely upon your entire support,
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 272 -->
the contest would be too difficult; may I do
{empty}A. O 'J
so i


\"I wish to goodness you Avere a man,
Adele ! " exclaimed the Marquis; "it would
be a pleasure to help you—you would make a
capital Deputy, and, what's more, you would
somehow or other be sure of being nominated
one, whereas Olivier "


\"Olivier Avill be quite certain if you take the
thing up actively."


\"Actively ? " echoed M. de Moranges;
\"that's more easily said than done. But who
do you suppose Avill contest the election with
you?" inquired the Marquis.


\"First," she remarked, " there is M. de
Laprunaye, in our district, he is by way of
being a clever man and moderate, and goes in
for agriculture. I think Ave can manage him;
then there's Achille Bouvier, the attorney's
son at Combeville, he is a serious antagonist,
one of those rabid demagogues whom the
government delights in bringing over to its
service, an atheist, and with all the
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 273 -->
freethinkers at his back : well, I don't yet see
what is to be done with him; he's very
strong at Combeville, and he's got some
supporters at Malleray, besides a good many in
Brunoy."  
  
  
  " What, in my district?" cried the Marquis.


\"Yes, never mind that, it's not against
Bouvier that I need your help. But there's
another candidate. The Due de Vivienne will,
I believe, bring Gaston forAvard."  
  
  
  " His nephew ? "


\"Yes; and the plan, I fancy, is, to marry
Gaston to his cousin Herminie, and so unite
in one the two enormous fortunes of the two
mothers."


"True," murmured the Marquis, rubbing
his chin with his hand and pulling down his
nether lip between his finger and thumb.
\"Bless my soul! " continued he; " why that
would give Gaston one day two millions
ayear—that's enormous ! "


\"Yes; and add to that the Deputation,"
observed the Dowager, leaning forwardstoVOL. I.  
  
  
  T
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 274 -->
wards her brother; " and what would become
of us?"


There was a pause of a feAv seconds, during
which the brother and sister looked at each
other; at last said the Marquise, cautiously :


\"But it will require a great deal of
money."


\"These things always do," propounded M.
de Moranges; " but, luckily, Olivier has loads
of money to spare, thanks to your admirable
administration during his minority. But
then, on what line of policy would you bring
him in, my dear sister ? As the Government
candidate ?"


\"God forbid ! " and the Dowager started
upon her chair.


\"But then, as what ? As a Royalist devoted
to the past?"


\"As an honest man, and a Christian devoted
to religion—and order ! " said Madame de
Beauvoisin, with dignified gravity.


\"Ah ! yes, I know ! order !—that means
the Throne and the Altar in a new dress: my
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 275 -->
dear Adele," added the Marquis, "the Viviennes
can play at that game better than you."


\"But if you fall off from them, Maurice,
they can play no game at all; they count
on you, and on the Bishop, and if you
resolutely stand by Olivier I will detach
Monseigneur."


\"So, it will be a war of uncles," remarked
he; " Moranges versus Vivienne! a fresh
Provincial feud—as though there were not enough
such already in our distracted party, as we still
persist in denominating it "


\"At all events that's preferable to letting the
Viviennes rule over us all, throughout the whole
Department, as they will do if once they get
hold of a seat in the Chamber."


\"Well! " objected M. de Moranges, " they
say Gaston is a clever fellow."


\"That's only because he talks more than
other young men, and lays down the law on
what are called serious subjects — he's a
'young dogmatique,' as Montalembert calls
them."  
  
  
  T 2
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 276 -->

\"What will Olivier do in the Corps
Legislates?" demanded his uncle.


"Just what the vast majority
does—nothing," responded his mother. " But you
see, yourself, that if Ave are not elected, our
influence in Savre-et-Merle is lost for ever;
Olivier is the only one who can represent  
  
  
  us—unless, indeed, my dear brother, unless

you "


\"I! " exclaimed Moranges, with a tone and
gesture of downright horror,—" I! why, I would
sooner be hung ! "  
  
  
  His sister smiled.  
  
  
  " So I thought," said she, with a smile.  
  
  
  There was again a pause.


\"Then I may count upon you, Maurice;
and I can Avrite at once to Durochard ? " said
the Dowager.
O


\"Certainly," answered her brother; " Avhat
must be, must be : but I warn you beforehand
that this contest, Avill cost Olivier more than
you fancy."  
  
  
  The Marquise gave a look to M. de Moranges
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 277 -->
that was meant to be engaging, and suggestive
of a great deal.


\"Well," continued she, " it is, as you say, a
Avar of uncles; the Due de Vivienne will
probably help Gaston largely, in a financial point,
of ATiew."


\"Luckily my nephew does not need that
proof of affection on my part," retorted the
Marquis, "for I could not give it him.
I have plenty to do with my fortune
without touching politics (which I hate); and
luckily, also, Olivier is twice as rich as
I am."


When M. de Moranges took leave of his
sister, the latter watched, with a sharp gaze,
his retreating figure, and continued aftenvards
to watch the door by which he had made his
exit.


\"No money ! " whispered she to herself, as
she carefully rolled up her AA'hite wools, and
put everything connected with her work in its
proper place. "No money! No! he will
never be to be counted upon for one hour, or
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 278 -->
  
  for one sou, so long as that woman remains
there."  
  
  
  
Madame de Beauvoisin had arrived at that
moral crossing where two roads intersect each
other, one pointing to what strictly ought, the
other, to what possibly might be.
<!-- Leaf 291 -->
  
  CHAPTER XX.  
  
  
  TWO POWERS.


When people wish for anything very much,
they invariably begin by setting limits to what
they would do to obtain their wish, and they
almost always end by, in fact, doing something
they regarded as positively blameable, nay
impossible.


Now, day by day, the longing of the Dowager
to separate her brother from the Sphinx was
growing stronger, and found less readily any
means of satisfaction. But then what Henri
Dupont de Laporte had said of Aspasie
Mourjon recurred to her, and she thought what a
vexatious thing it was that she could not be in
communication with this person, and what an
excellent thing it would be if she were so, and
she pondered over the whole situation, and
<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 280 -->
soon got to ask herself why it Avas so utterly
impossible that she, the Dowager Marquise de
Beauvoisin nee Moranges, should, for a potent
interest, hold converse with Mile. Aspasie de
Mourjonville ? Extraordinary things Avere done
every day, and—when they succeeded—no one
objected to them; besides, surely secresy could
be secured, surely she, the DoAvager, had means
at her disposal of binding over the intelligent
Aspasie to her service; surely she could at a
moderate cost ensure the co-operation of this
most useful ally!


At last the Dowager was satisfied that Mile.
de Mourjonville was individually a
fellowcreature who might enjoy the honour of an
intervieAv with herself, and she soon settled
the mode in which the intervieAv was to be
brought about.


Claudine had the same dressmaker as the
DoAvager, with this difference, that whereas
Claudine caused every \restment she ever wore
to be fashioned by the celebrated couturiere,
the DoAvager duly ordered from her a certain
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 281 -->
number of pattern-dresses, which she then had
copied by smaller people or sometimes even
by her own maid. Nothing was easier than to
meet Aspasie by chance, and Madame de
Beauvoisin decided that this was precisely
what she would do.


One day in the middle of all the silks, laces,
and costly stuffs that east and Avest could
furnish for the adornment of hyper-civilized
AAToman, and a few days previous to a grand
public ball to be given at the Opera, the
Dowager found herself by chance standing
face to face with Mile, de Mourjonville, with
a Buhl table between them, and a deep
flounce of Chantilly lace held by a hand of
each. The Dowager had the advantage at the
outset, for she had made up her mind and
knew what she Avas about, whereas our friend
Aspasie was totally unprepared. No wonder
therefore that she was somewhat taken aback,
and actually let the lace drop out of her hand
when she saw the needle-sharp eyes of the
Marquise fixed upon her, and so close too!
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 282 -->
The Marquise was gracious—patronising, no
doubt—but gracious unmistakeably, and she
smiled at Aspasie with a smile that did duty
for a boAv.


"You have good taste, Mademoiselle," said
she; "that lace is really beautiful."
Mademoiselle Mourjon was a woman and a
Frenchwoman, and she would have been neither had
she not been flattered by this eulogy from a
real lady! a lady belonging to the purest
Faubourg St. Germain ! Aspasie Avas flattered,
and involuntarily giving the DoAvager more
than her clue, as people mostly do to those
AAdio exalt them, she actually blushed, and
could only express her opinion that Madame
la Marquise Avas too good.


The DoAvager looked her full in the face,
took her, mentally, in, AAdiole and entire, and
thought she knew all about her, which was a
mistake, and attributable solely to Aspasie's
momentary embarrassment, the said Aspasie
being immensely the Dowager's superior in
certain points. When the Marquise had, as
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 283 -->
she believed, mastered a thorough knowledge
of her adversary, she advanced a step further.


"Alas ! " said she, " we know each other, I
see," (Mile, de Mourjonville was more than
ever perplexed). "My poor brother!" and
into this exclamation the Dowager threw a large
amount of Christian commiseration.


"Don't imagine, Mademoiselle," vouchsafed
she, with dignified kindness, " that in our
family we do not know how to distinguish
between those who are the misfortune of our
nearest and dearest, and those who, on the
contrary, have been obliged by circumstances
to serve where they cannot esteem; we all of
us know perfectly Avell your claim to indulgence
—to consideration—and we are rejoiced that
my unhappy brother should have found so
trustworthy a person to preside over his
household, and, of course, in a certain degree, his
interests."


After this preamble the Dowager drew
Aspasie into a conversation, in w-hich the two
points made clear to the latter's mind were,
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 284 -->
that in his Avorld M. de Moranges was a man
to be pitied, and spoken of as lost; and that
there might be some gain achieved by serving
the pious sister's plans for rescuing an erring
brother's soul.


Much beyond this Aspasie did not get at
first; but she fixed upon a second meeting
the next day Avith Madame de Beauvoisin.
This meeting Avas to take place in a private
room at the fashionable dressmaker's; and as
she Avent away, the DoAvager ordered for
herself a plain, grey silk goAvn and cloak, quite
plain — she always dressed so simply — and
which Avas only to cost a thousand francs.


So the next day this pair met again, but in
very different conditions, for noAv Mile.
Mourjon knew what she was about, and was equal to
a brace of Dowagers.


The demureness of aspect of the lady in
Avaiting was such as to confound Madame de
Beauvoisin. In the minutest details of her
attire there Avas not so much as a thread but
bore Avitness to virtue; the very buttons of her
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 285 -->
gloves were fastened severely, and the boAv
of her bonnet strings under her chin attested
the habit of sacrifice upon the altar of les
convenances.


The Marquise was an authority upon these
subjects, and she could not refuse her
unqualified admiration to the Avoman before her.
The get-up was perfect. From boot to chignon,
all AAras so subdued, so quiet; and the face
itself, too, had been so well composed over
night, and all its salient points so toned down.
No more aggressive sparkle in the eye, no
more impertinence in the nose, no more
contempt in the mouth, no more mischief
anywhere. Every advantage of this kind was left
to the grande dame, Avho was treated with
deference, and with the completest
acknowledgment of all her superiorities.


From the outset Aspasie accepted the
situation of M. de Moranges as deplorable, and
indulged in the most approved lamentations,
commented upon and underlined, as it were,
by deprecatory looks, eyes uplifted, and sighs.
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 286 -->
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful; but what
could she, Aspasie de Mourjonville, do ? She
had her bread to earn, and the Marquis was a
generous employer, just, too, and full of
consideration for those who served him honestly.
All that she could do Avas to keep herself clear
of moral contamination, as it befitted the child
of poor but respectable parents; and she
mentioned her estimable family, as was her wont,
with touching dignity.


\"Though, in reality, Madame la Marquise,"
said she, " my view of your brother's conduct is
the same as yours, I cannot afford to abandon
my situation. I must live, not for my own
sake only."


\"Of course, of course," responded the
Dowager; " and it would be our duty to take
care of your future; but surely if that Avoman,"
(it Avas in these terms that Claudine was
invariably alluded to), " if that Avoman could be
got rid of, and thereby my brother's fortune
saved, we might combine to ensure your
existence. What are your Avages ? "
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 287 -->

The word escaped the DoAA-ager, and much
offended Mademoiselle Mourjon (who did not
show it).


\"My wages, Madame la Marquise," she
replied with terrible humility, "are six
thousand francs a year."


The Marquise was a far less accomplished
actress than Aspasie, for the simple reason that
she had never needed to play a part, having
always had her own Avay through life. This
led her astray.


\"Six thousand francs! " she exclaimed;
"well! that is enormous!" (one rapid, unseen
glance shot from beneath Aspasie's eyelids),
\"enormous—not too much for your merits,"
added she, all at once correcting herself, " but,
I mean, a great deal in itself for the position."


\"Yes ! " rejoined, meekly, Mile. Mourjon, " to
be overseer to a person like Madame Claudine,
and go into public places with her!" and she
indulged in a slight shudder.


\"That is what I mean," responded the
Dowager; "and besides that, one must take
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 288 -->
a fair half from the salary " (she did not say
wages this time) " for the dress. You have to
dress handsomely " (she cast an arithmetical
glance 0A7er Aspasie's toilette), "you can't dress
under three thousand francs a year."


\"I do not spend one," replied Mile. Mourjon
in the gentlest of tones, "for M. le Marquis
is \rery considerate, and furnishes the larger
portion of the dress which he knows to be
necessary."


\"Humph ! " snorted the Dowager, displeased,
and sliOAving it; " but at all events, you see, even
if Ave put it at the Avhole six thousand francs—
no! we can say fiAre—well at five thousand
francs a year, it can never be more than a
temporary engagement, the affair of a feAv
years. I am a person of large ideas in affairs,
I never aim at little savings—suppose we count
upon ten years of employ :—that's a round sum;
ten times five, that makes fifty thousand francs."


"But why should it last only ten years?"
asked Aspasie, in a voice that kept groAving
softer and softer.
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 289 -->

\"My dear child! only ten years! why, do
you imagine that Moranges will have continued
ten years with that woman ? And even suppose
he did, why—what age is she ? " she suddenly
inquired.  
  
  
  " Nineteen."


\"Well — ten years; that'll be
nine-andtwenty; humph ! she may last; she's a blonde.
She will fatten and look well. My dear, what
age are you? "


Madame la Marquise, like all utterly selfish
people and all people who have the passion
of rapacity, was losing sight of her interest
in the exclusive pursuit of her immediate
object;—she was losing her game with Mile.
Aspasie, and arousing in the latter a feeling
of hostility that she was a thousand miles from
discerning.  
  
  
  " What age are you ? " she repeated, " thirty ?

eh?"


\"Yes, Madame la Marquise, I am thirty—
just thirty (she was thirty-four).  
  
  
  " Well then, count! In ten years you'll be  
  
  
  V  
  
  
  VOL. I.
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 290 -->
forty, and you won't fill out—dark women
don't, women of our kind," (the Marquise was
so eager that she went in for what she thought
condescension!), " Avomen of our kind don't
improve. I know Moranges. When you get
to look like an English old maid, lean and
angular, as you will do, he will politely dismiss
you—he will have nice looking women in his
establishment, rely upon that. Now, you are a
practical person as I am, and respectable, and
have never cared for the sinful vanities of the
lives led by such creatures as that woman,
therefore it behoves you to take care of
yourself."


\"And Madame la Marquise will help me to
do so ? " suggested Aspasie.


"My idea would be," rejoined the practical
Dowager, " that you should be enabled to retire
upon an independence of say four or five
thousand francs a-year of your own—which is
the double of what I prove to you that you can
ever hope to gain;—we said ten years at five
thousand francs "
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 291 -->
  
  "It is six," murmured Aspasie.


\"Yes—but the dress!" decided the Dowager,
\"five counting the dress—well, ten years at
five thousand, would make you fifty thousand
francs; now if I secured to you one hundred
thousand francs you would have five thousand
francs a-year all your life."


"The Marquis's fortune ought to go to
Monsieur Olivier de Beauvoisin, your son,
ought it not ? "  
  
  
  " Naturally—Olivier is his sole heir


\"And people say M. de Moranges has two
or three hundred thousand francs a-year."


\"Alas!" sighed the Dowager, " I fear not
so much now—he is driving hard towards

rum.


\"But I don't think Madame Claudine is the
cause of that," remarked Aspasie; "she is too
stupid to drag him into any extravagance."


\"No! but she's the pretext," retorted the
Dowager."It's that establishment of his
which is ruining him."  
  
  
  " But if she were to run away to-morroAv  
  
  
  u 2
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 292 -->
Avith some one," objected Mile. Mourjon, " he
might still go on entertaining."


\"Not he !" exclaimed the Dowager. " His
vanity would be so hurt that he would shut
up his house, and retire into the provinces—
I know my brother—and I know Avhere
the danger lies—that woman must be got
rid of."  
  
  
  " But Madame la Marquise, he may marry !"


\"Never-! that is the one price Moranges
will not pay for the right of receiving people at
his house—he will pay with his money, not
with his freedom."


When Mile, de Mourjonville parted from
the Marquise, she agreed to think Avell over
the proposal made to her, to study well the
state of affairs at the Hotel de Moranges,
and see whether the notion of getting rid of
Claudine was a feasible one or not, and to
report progress to her protectress within a few
days.


\"What a pity ! " vouchsafed the Marquise
as she bade adieu to Aspasie; " what a pity
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 293 -->
that his choice had not fallen upon such a
woman as you, instead of upon that creature !
With a clever head one can always come to an
understanding!"


\"You forget, Madame la Marquise,"
responded Mile, de Mourjonville, in accents of
injured innocence; " you forget that, with my
education and respectable (though poor) parents,
that w^ould have been impossible. I should
have always resisted M. le Marquis, or—married
him ! " She dropped these words and a deep
curtsey together.


The Dowager for a second or two was too
thoroughly stunned to speak—Aspasie did so
for her.


\"It is better as it is," she observed gently,
"for I may be the means of restoring your
brother to his family; let us hope for the best,"
and she left the Marquise with a vague
impression of doubt as to what was the real nature
of Mile, de Mourjonville.


When the latter left the dressmaker's door
to wend her way back to the Hotel de
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 294 -->
Moranges, she passed through the passage St. Roch,
a very unfrequented alley, and was accosted by
Theophile Mardonnet.


"Here I am!" he said, taking off his hat,
\"obedient to your summons; it is precisely
twelve o'clock."


\"My good friend," she replied, slackening
her pace, and looking her companion full in the
iiice; "I am not going to walk in the public
streets of Paris with you by my side; at the
entrance of the Rue St. Honore we part; but I
have something to say to you, and it is simply
this : I will be put in possession of all the
details of what passed seven years ago—I mean
touching Camille and Olivier—I will know the
whole."


\"But if there is nothing to know ? " replied
Mardonnet, trying to look indifferent.


Mile. Mourjon came to a full stop. " Well,"
she ansAvered very quietly, " if that be really
the case—if I do know all, and that you have
nothing more to tell me," (Mardonnet began
to look hopeful), " then so much the worse
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 295 -->
  
  for you—for you will find me amongst your
opponents."  
  
  
  
And bowing courteously to him she walked
on, leaving our friend Mardonnet gazing intently
on the pavement, and lifting his hat up, and
rubbing his forehead with his hand as though
he were perplexed.

  CHAPTER XXI.  
  
  
  CHORDS THAT VIBRATE.


When Henri Dupont de Laporte told the
Dowager that Olivier could inform her better
than any one else of all that had happened at
the fete given by M. de Moranges in the forest
of St. Germain, he told her what was strictly
true, only the word all was susceptible of two
readings. According to one reading the all
was nothing; according to the other, the
nothing was by far too much. But this was
Olivier's secret, and it was not one he was
likely to impart to his mother.


In truth, it would have been hard to say to
whom he could have related Avhat had passed,
for he avoided as much as possible avowing
to himself that anything had passed. And in
reality what had happened? Simply that
<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 297 -->
which will happen when the system of marriage
(consequently the social system) is based upon
the exclusion of love.


Though Claire was as lovely as it had ever
fallen to the lot of a woman to be, she was not
lovely to her husband, for she loved him not,
and Avas not trained to think it wrong to marry
wdthout love, but on the contrary. What then
could become of these two ?


Olivier thought life a dull job, but not very
much more so since his marriage. He had
found out how to deceive his guardians, in
early days, and whether his wife or his mother
were the deceived party, did not much matter,
so long as he was free to do whatever he liked
without any disagreeable results. " Whatever
he liked." Yes ! but did Olivier like anything ?
Well, there was the rub — and our friend
Aspasie was right in her appreciation of M.
de Beauvoisin. He rather liked music,
certainly a particular kind of music, that which
appealed solely to the senses, or came under
the head of mere amusement. He was liable
<!-- Leaf 310, Page: 298 -->
to be impressed by a beautiful voice, and
Claudine had an unmistakeably beautiful one.


One day, as I have said, this voice trembled
Avith passion, and the first note of a chord was
struck which at first died away in silence.
Olivier Avas as yet careless of Claudine, but
Claudine was changed towards Olivier.


Olivier had got to be the daily visitor at the
Hotel de Moranges, and his uncle seemed used
to his presence. He seemed even to have taken
a sort of liking to him, and when M. de
Moranges arranged the splendid fete he offered
to his Hungarian guest, it was natural that
Claudine should be confided to Olivier. When
evening came on, M. de Beauvoisin sat by the
Sphinx at the gorgeous dinner presided over
by his uncle. She was singularly beautiful
that night, but silent beyond her wont. On
the other side of her sat the Hungarian Count,
and the remarks he permitted himself upon her
beauty were such as to rouse Olivier into paying
unusual attention to her.  
  
  
  When the banquet was over, the whole
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 299 -->
party adjourned to the miniature theatre that
{empty}M. de Moranges had obtained leave to have
constructed for a dozen hours in the centre of
one of the clearings of the forest,


The theatre was a band-box naturally,—a
thorough miniature, in the Trianon style,
exquisitely pretty, not too glaringly lighted; but
in it, as M. de Moranges himself said, on
entering it, one thing had been omitted: a
public, namely, of wax-work spectators. At this
omission, the donor of the fete was
inconsolable. 4' I ought to have thought of that! " he
exclaimed, as he cast a rapid glance over the
necessarily unoccupied benches, which, few and
well-contrived as they were, and masked by
bushes of flowers, could not be otherwise than

empty.


In the centre box sat M. de Moranges and
bis Hungarian friend, and two other men of
such rank and fame that they stood apart from
all others. In the proscenium box to the right,
sat the Sphinx; in that to the left, our friend
Aspasie, who, on that evening, free from
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 300 -->
constrains, and more or less left to her own
devices, was Mile, de Mourjonville with a
vengeance. The fair Aspasie had her court, and
played sovereign in it with the greatest possible
ease; far outdoing Claudine in that respect;
Claudine showing herself, as has been noted,
singularly taciturn and inanimate on this
occasion.


I have said that Olivier's attention had been
drawn toward Claudine by the openly
expressed admiration of the Hungarian Count;
and, as he sat beside her in the box, he could
not choose but remark to himself Iioav strangely
beautiful she Avas, and what a singular charm
was hers. It was not her beauty only, it Avas
the spell which, on that particular night,
belonged to her, and was, as it were, the
emanation of her Avhole being. All women, in the
fatal hour of triumph of this kind, move in an
atmosphere of their own, and, Avhen they
subjugate the senses of poor mortals, they are
veiled in the goddess-cloud, Avhich renders them
invincible. It may be but for an hour, a
<!-- Leaf 313, Page: 301 -->
moment, but that moment may destroy a life,
and it comes almost certainly once. It had
come for Olivier de Beauvoisin.


A heavy atmosphere gathered round those
two as they sat side by side listening in silence
to dangerous music, and the very air filled with
perfume and love-charged looks.


\"I fancy connoisseurs think her singing
admirable," said, slowly and languidly, Claudine,
as though she felt she ought to speak; " but
how coldly she sings! "


"I would rather hear you sing!" replied
Olivier, in a whisper.


Why did he speak so low? He couldn't
tell; but he couldn't have spoken louder for
the life of him.  
  
  
  Another long silence; and then,—


\"One would really think your friend, Count
Dupont, was paying court to Aspasie," observed
Claudine, in the same slow and oppressed tone.
"Look at him; how absorbed he seems by her."


\"He will never pay court to anyone,"
murmured Olivier; " he is bronzed."
<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 302 -->

\"Ah ! " The Avord dropped from the moist
ruby lips of the Sphinx, lingering as it dropped,
with curious significance.


\"You do not like my friend Henri," pursued
Olivier, as though forcing himself to speech by
a strong effort; " yet he is an intense admirer
of yours."


"Of mine?" and the question was
commented on by a slow but negative shake of the
head.


\"Of yours," repeated Olivier. " Why should
he escape the common lot ?" and his voice
sank lower with each word he uttered, and he
fed with his eyes upon the flush Avhich each
Avord called up on the magnolia-pale surface of
Claudine's pale brow and cheek. " Do you
know," he added, coming closer to her, so that
the perfumes of her hair and of her breath
wrapt him round. " Do you know that Henri
has a legend about you ? He says he saw you
once, long ago, down in the country, near to us.
A strange idea, isn't it?—quite a dream.
But he persists in it."
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 303 -->

The Avhisper was hushed on Olivier's lip by
the effect of what he had said. The flush died
out on Claudine's cheek and brow, leaving
them paler than any magnolia leaf had ever
been, the lids closed over her dark, dangerous
eyes, and an involuntary shiver passed over
her limbs as she tightly grasped the arm of the
chair on which she sat.


It was the affair of two seconds; when
Claudine spoke again it was in an altered tone,
and on indifferent subjects. She looked no
more at her companion.


When the theatrical performance Avas over,
{empty}M. de Moranges and his guests went to pay
their compliments to the great artists who had
enchanted them. Aspasie insisted on dragging
off Count Dupont to see how the machinery of
a theatre was worked (as though she had never
before had an opportunity of acquiring this
knowledge).


Olivier and Claudine stood alone upon the
peristyle that had been erected as an entrance
to the temporary little opera house. In front
<!-- Leaf 316, Page: 304 -->
of them lay the forest, with small snaky white
paths winding through all its greenery, and
catching here and there in the dim distance a
white ray of the moon.


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin tendered his arm to the
Sphinx, and silently they went towards the
forest paths, till there soon was nothing around
them save the dark leafy wealth of the solemn
wood, with the silver flood of the moonlight
breaking in upon the mossy sward, and the
smell of the earth and of the flowers rising up
nto the night air.


For some time neither spoke, but the
breathing and the gait of both wrere unsteady,
faltering under the mysterious weight that was
oppressing them.


\"Claudine," said Olivier, in a scarcely
audible voice; " were you hurt by what I told
you just noAv of Henri Dupont ? why were you
so?"


And saying this, he took in his the soft hand
that lay heavy on his arm.  
  
  
  No answer came in words; but the bounding
<!-- Leaf 317, Page: 305 -->
pulse responded—her head sank upon his
shoulder, as an overladen flower that inclines to
earth. Their lips, cold and trembling, met.


Love has countless different modes of
expression—passion has but one. It is the same
always; the same which compelled Francesca
and Paolo to read no more that day, and which
will doom to misery and ruin so many
countless myriads of souls in this our inexplicable
existence.


This was what had happened at the fete
of the Marquis de Moranges, and at which
Henri Dupont never guessed. Was it all ? or
was it nothing ? That is as it may be—it was
perhaps neither, but simply, as Mercutio says,
Enough.
